    "# Scrapping data with PRAW library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Python Notebook file, I am going to set up everything to scrap data from Reddit. Reddit has its own API to access their data. PRAW is my choice because it respects the terms of use stated by Reddit, is open-source and has the support of a big community and the very Reddit. For scrapping data from Reddit, my first choice and recommendation is to prefer PRAW over other data scrapping libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the moment to design what database models will best suit your interests. In this project, I am separating comments and posts in two different .csv files. I added a row called post_id, so I can use it to track the origin of each comment as well as the unique id of each post. I have chosen this database model because it would allow further researchers to more easily work with the textual productions from comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is using an hierarchical database, like a JSON file, and nest the comments inside each post. While it is also a valuable form of organizing data, it would require more computer processing power when analyzing only the comments, since further analysis algorithms would need to read all the posts just to find the nested comments.

    "### Hands on! Performing the actual data scrapping using PRAW and saving it in a CSV database\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, I start setting up the PRAW library to conduct the search for the keywords \"rape\" and \"raping\" in the CrusaderKings subreddit. I created two lists, one called \"posts\" and the other one called \"processed posts IDs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, I can keep track of the post IDs that I already processed and prevent the creation of duplicated posts when using a similar keyword for my search, as it is the case of \"rape\" and \"raping.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this data scraping is conducting a loop search that will retrieve all the posts with the keyword \"rape\" in the title of the posts or the content of the posts. Then, I repeat the process using a similar keyword (i.e., \"raping\"), since I could expand the variety of posts that talk about this same subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "I store the post IDs, the titles, the body, the general score, the upvotes, and the downvotes from each Reddit post that was retrieved from this keyword search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some circumstances, the comments might not have a general score, nor a score of upvotes nor downvotes. To prevent errors, I test if these categories are empty and I add a null value to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each loop, I save all the posts and comments that I scraped from Reddit in two different files, one file for the posts and another file for the comments. So, I print a message saying that every post and comment was saved in its respective CSV files successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you visualizing each post being scrapped, I also added printing lines to say the title of each post, followed by the keyword that was used for it to be retrieved. "
