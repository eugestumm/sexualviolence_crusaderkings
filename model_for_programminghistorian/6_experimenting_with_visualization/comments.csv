12u8ey2,jh5tk3t,"If you stumble into feudalization unprepared, you're getting screwed.

Tribal is powerful in the early era, so use it to raid and stockpile gold and fame, to conquer valuable land, steal competent people, make hybrids for good traditions, steal artifacts. When you're ready, you switch to feudal. Not one single day sooner.

The point of feudal is that is grows massively in economic and military power the longer the game goes on. It's the switch and the early years that is so hard.

Of course, you can stay tribal and keep your useless masses of levies if you think it's the best. Should you for some reason not see the benefit of three eras worth of innovations, of upgrading buildings to lvl 8 and of unlocking some of the best unit types, then you're beyond help.",8,8,0
12u8ey2,jh674n3,"You need to make money to support your army. When you first switch to feudal, the culture shock of your troops not costing prestige anymore can gimp you if you are not prepared. 

Check your castles and build appropriate money making buildings. Dump your verangian units. They are too expensive for you now. Stick with bowmen. Cheap and effective. When you can comfortably make around 50g/mo then you can consider stacking expensive MaAs, but say goodbye to your levies. They will not be worth the cost to raise them anymore.",1,1,0
12u8ey2,jh7mrit,"Tribal is a series of power spikes. You have the best knights, strongest men at arms, easy gold, easy prestige and easy piety. However, a Tribal ruler will eventually reach a threshold where they can't get any stronger.

Feudal and Clan have much higher potential. Gold becomes more reliable to gain. Men at Arms become stronger. Vassals are easier to control. And most importantly, realms don't dissolve over inheritance.

If Tribal is linear with a series of spikes, Feudal is exponential growth.",1,1,0

11a5948,j9qskdy,"I’ve been crying about 2 things since 2020:


1. Let us actually revoke holy orders from counties.  A bug has always prevented the player from revoking hostile holy orders despite directly owning the county.  The workaround involves giving the title to a ghost mayor and revoking it later. 


2. Provide an option to join your liege against populist factions that involve your counties.
Just because my liege is in 5 wars with 45 troops left and will give in to the smallest factions doesn’t mean his giga vassal (me) can’t put those down.  I lost my entire capital duchy to a populist revolt that was 1/6 my army size because my liege gave into their demands without a fight.",76,76,0
11a5948,j9qdajo,"Do you know how incredibly bugged out the console version is? The controls are a joke, you sometimes have to fight the d pad just to move through a menu. The cursor drift is the worse I’ve ever seen. You sometimes can get stuck in tool tip mode and must restart your controller to get out of it. Sometimes the option to select just doesn’t show up in a menu, to the point that you have to restart the game just to change one of your councilors. It’s honestly ridiculous. 

And multiplayer? Forget about it. You’re lucky if anything works the way it’s supposed to.

11a5948,j9r0rji,"My favorite is how inviting characters to court is impossible.

* My father-in-law is an independent count
* He gets conquered and moves to a nearby kingdom, instead of moving to my court (where his only child lives)
* He also refuses an invitation to join my court despite my gifts
* I want to restore his county to him, so I conquer the county back from the usurper
* Despite reconquering the county, I can't give it to him because he is abroad
* Therefore I conquer the kingdom where he is staying, hoping that he will join my court
* Instead, he teleports outside of diplorange

Take the Nubians, Daju, or Akan, whose cultures make their succession female preference.

11a5948,j9qspsd,"If I were the devs, I would have polished the game before thinking of releasing any DLC. Seriously, I think almost every DLC brought new bugs. Did you know that your chaste/just spouse will chose to sleep with an inspired person? And this event makes no checks for soulmates. Just/honest characters can’t seduce people without stress but can romance despite that also being adultery. Makes complete sense. 

I can’t even take this game seriously as an RP game. Like you said, significant events don’t get logged. My family members can f*k off to another court but I don’t get a notification for that. Can’t imprison people for valid reasons because they refuse. Your heir hustling his K/D ratio even when he’s just or compassionate. Gotta love the serial killer event. No. My soulmate husband made fun of me giving me a dumb nickname during a failed homage. Enjoy a second walk to Canossa dumbass. Just/honest characters killing themselves via stress by seducing random people. 

Make a custom ruler/play as a kid/even educate a kid. Wait until they turn 16 only to get their education invalided because of a dumb bug the devs still have not fixed.

Lastly, make an option where we could play with some of the bugs. As much as I’m annoyed at s lot of the bugs, some are just too funny. I could get my rival dad to loose opinion of himself for making a false feast invite.",23,23,0

11a5948,j9r52h7,"Coming from stellaris devs to this game it really feels like j was spoiled by stellaris development. Stellaris goes back and adds new features to their old dlc/fixes bugs. 

CK3 devs just feel like they don't care about the game or they're not allowed to release a finished product. So far all the ck3 dlcs have been shitty cash grabs, this is coming from someone that bought them all.

I'm still very pissed that there are no Battlefield duels still and the player is hard coded to never become a knight.

I just don't think this *should* be a casus belli.  Going to *war* for personal revenge?  Did this ever happen outside of legend?  I am honestly asking.  It seems like a matter for a duel, not for a war.

The rest of your points seem solid.  Memories are very very strange in what they include and don't include.  ""Murder is fine if it's not kinslaying"" is very weird but idk whether it's based in history or not?

wgl2hf,ij1ymo5,"I think there's nothing wrong with char traits themselves but the game could use a trait mutation system to make these kind of situations make more sense. A trait would be ""tested"" and if a character continues to push it it breaks, character gains a stress level and the trait is replaced with something else.

wgl2hf,ij1uicm,"The thing is, in today's society most people that think they're compassionate and empathic - really aren't. Most people that think they're nice, in actuality aren't.

There is a bit of an exaggeration in the game in both the Compassionate and, say, the Shy trait, but there's also the factor many people today think they know what being Compassionate is when they really don't.

Take politics for an example. Right leaning people will think they're compassionate because of their religious values, until they meet a Satanist that seeks to demolish all they stand for. Left leaning people think they're compassionate because of their hyper empathy for some kids in the middle east, until they meet a conservative.

Reality is most people today that think they're compassionate, really aren't, and are just posers riding imaginary high horses.

Yes, a compassionate person would be stressed out committing pain and spreading death onto any other living human, compassion and empathy aren't something you can just flip a switch on and turn it off when someone's committed something abhorrent.

You can't *choose* whom you're going to be compassionate towards, because then you're not really compassionate.",1,1,0

One thing that does cut in your favor is that you view adultery and fornication as criminal, even for men. You view practically *everything* as criminal, in fact, so you might be able to find some dirty secrets that disqualify your vassals from ruling.

Ultimately Vikings weren't especially interested in governing milk-drinkers. Consider reforming Ásatrú if you're built different.

-Converted to Catholicism and tried to fight the Ummayads, getting rekt


-the lands split in half by Gavelkind and then united by a holy war against the catholic brother

6lo5jg,djvaazd,"Improve your [holdings](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Holdings) and then your vassals holdings.  Stop playing pagans. Adjust your laws to require more levies. Improve your martial skill and have a marshal with a high one.

[This is all in the wiki](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Levies)",8,8,0
6lo5jg,djvd2ki,"Basically you want to have as large of a stable personal demense as possible, upgrade your the holdings you actually own (basically the castle you own in county) with all the things that say they increase levy size primarily.

I also recommend that you shift laws to favor taxation from burghers and clergymen as opposed to levies as the levies your city and chruch vassals provide are pretty bad. It is much more worth it to be getting the extra tax income to further upgrade holdings and finance your army.

Keep your vassals happy, and slowly increase things like crown authority (while still keeping them happy) to increase the amount of troops they will provide you.

Make sure you have your marshal in your capital on a counsel mission to increase levies.

Once you have a stable income I'd say you should also begin investing in retinues, which are basically small armies of a single unit type. The defense retinue is typically the best retinue as the pikemen which make up the majority of it are usually the best you can buy for battle for a cheaper cost. Keep in mind that they will take a large amount of your monthly income while they are reinforcing depending on the speed you have set for them to reinforce after troops die. Use max speed when you can afford it, half speed during wars (so they still reinforce while not killing your coffers) so long as you can afford it. In the even that the montly cost will quickly bankrupt you, just set them to not reinforce temporarily. The standing army (retinues) will also cost a lot to maintain when they are fully reinforced, typically only 2-3 gold per month.

In the event that you will not be able to take on your foes (you can check their levy size on their character portrait for a general idea), you will need the help of others. This is where political marriages come into play. Marry off your generally useless daughters to all the biggest bois in Europe to gain alliances. This will let you call them into your wars to help if they like you. Be sure to keep in mind that they can call you into their wars too! Refusing their call will cost you lots of prestige, make everyone hate you with the ""alliance-breaker"" opinion modifier, and will also break the alliance you fucked so hard to gain. Just because you are allies in the war doesn't mean you actually have to do anything to help. You will receive no real penalties if you do not decide to throw troops into a foreign war if you do not want to.

If you simply cannot win a war as the aggressor,it is far better to settle for a white peace instead of losing and having to pay a lot of money to the defender.

If cannot win as a defender you can either take the loss and try to move on withing the ten year truce you have with your attacker, convert to the attackers faith (holy wars only) and either stay that faith or convert back at a later time, or in the most dire of situations, you can willingly become a vassal of a larger ruler. They will defend your lands from attacks, meanwhile you can basically expand within the kingdom or outside to your whim at the expense of less freedom.

This means you need to own your capital duchy at the very least. You can plot to revoke any county in your capital duchy so do not be afraid to do so, they have higher troops so why not.

Now, if you have a high martial score martial then leave him in your capital to increase levy size and this all stacks. If you do not have a high martial score martial then invite one.

Upgrade your holdings in your capital, the capital will create lots of troops due to council job stacking with capital bonus. If severely under powered then consider a second castle in your capital.

Different pagan faiths also gain bonuses to levy/garrison numbers. If you are low on money then try playing as a raiding culture and take money that way.

Plus sometimes local buildings if battle is on the territory of your enemy or your territory and there are such buildings present.

As to the question of the battle you had, you can attack enemy in terrain that gives him advantage, but you need to compensate for it by some other factors. When you click your army to move in to enemy army, or when enemy army is moving in to your army, there will be small icon shown and tooltip will give you approximate chance of victory or defeat and rundown of all factors involved that give advantage either to you or your opponent. In case of your army this works over distance too, you don't have to stand right next to the enemy.

Also remember, if the battle happens at the location of a fort, defensive advantage goes to the side that holds that fort at the time (either owns it or have sieged it already).

AI will search defensive terrain when it sees that you are stronger. So you need to outsmart it. You don't need to defeat AI in battle to win the war. You need to siege down enemy holdings. So if you are stronger side, but not enough to overcome what ever defensive advantage enemy might have, just go and siege down his holdings while preventing him from sieging yours.

Actually I had gotten this achievement twice because the first time the achievement never went up due to a bug or something. The issue is not Abyssinia, heck no, they're easy to deal with. It's that the Abbasids/ Egypt are extremely aggressive Ai, that will gladly eat you up, gangbang you through holy wars. Half the time, they ended up conquering Abyssinia before I got to declare independence. In fact their constant aggression made me grow and never-ending hate for them where no matter what country I am playing through now. Anytime I take a prisoner from there, I will gladly execute them regardless of tyranny and if I'm playing Byzantine well... snip snip.

It's honestly waiting for the stars to align, I had to wait for at least one of them to not only be in regency but also be preoccupied in like 3-4 other wars before eating them up.

49p7z4,d0u95mz,"Many moments! (Thuringia start, 769)

* Managed to marry a child to the Saxon royal family. A bit later, while West Francia authority laws held back my inner expansion, the Saxon Queen (my kinswoman) was losing the elective vote to... me. My little County of Plauen made me an eligible candidate. 
And I won! Hooray! I'm a king! I can do EVERYTHING! It made my life quite easier.

* Well, not quite. Decades later, a Finnish warlord decided to Adventure Time my kingdom. He had 2 stacks of 6k troops, while I barely had one with 4k (just finished a war). His conquest of Saxony was pratically assured - his stacks, unmolested; my future, bleak. All my hopes were in those tiny ships coming all the way from... Byzantium. How that could be, you ask? Almost a century earlier, when I had at most 3 counties, I managed to slip a matrilinear marriage to the heir of Byzantine Empire (or he was the second in line and the older one died, dunno). Not only it became my forever ally, it became Catholic as well!
The Greek doomstacks saved the day back then. From that day on, I try to help the Byzantines as much as possible (It's 1150 and they're still strong!)

* After getting all the de jure counties of Germany and creating that kingdom, my wife died. Looking for a new one, I discovered that the Bavarian queen, at her tender 15 years old, was all alone and un-betrothed! I quickly seized the opportunity; as she matured into a full-blown germanic beauty, she gave me a son - but promptly died a year later.
I managed to elect the fruit of our passion (she was queer, but couldn't resist my audacious *Erfurt*, so to speak) as the first Kaiser of the Empire of Germania. Of course, I was some tech upgrades away from Imperial Administration, so the empire was basically an enormous kingdom.

* Minding my own business beating Italy out of my future HRE lands, I received an event saying that Middle Francia dukes created a faction and wanted to put ME as their king. Their actual king surrendered after 1 week of fighting and then I got the de jure lands of old Karloman (plus some Frisian, Brittanian and Irish lands). Karl der Grosse lands are still with France, but they're so weak it's a question of *when*, not *if* I'll grab them all.

* Managed to slip a child in the Polish royal family, and now my dinasty controls it. I'll save my Anchluss for later, regarding it.

* The Swedish king had twins. Gave the Kingdom of Norge (which was under his power back then) to one and nothing to the other. I manage to matri-marry a daughter to the second, just looking for an alliance. For some reason (I guess Gavelkind), the second son inherits Denmark and now I have another forever ally. It's been hard to find a non-von Thürigen to marry my kids these days.

* My nephew, who I installed as vice-king of Pomerania, had a claim on Lithuania. He pushed it and I helped him... now Lithuania and some extra counties are all under my rule. It's good to be the Emperor!

* Back some rulers before the Bavarian event, I had to destroy the Kingdom of Saxony title to avoid losing it on election to someone else that wasn't my heir. Centuries later, while thinking how to create it again (and give it as a vice-kingdom to ease my rule), my queen cuckolds my ruler and I send her back to her parents. I'm looking for another lovebird when... *deja vù!* the female heir of Kingdom of England is all alone and un-betrothed, while her mother is too old to give more children to her husband. I marry her and she produces a kid, who receives a small county and a vice-duchy to vote on himself for both Kingdom of Germania (which holds my 2 duchies) and the Empire. Also, as I educated him with a nice Anglo-Saxon pal of mine (duke of south Ireland), he'll get both England clay and the Saxony title!

After hiring african mercenaries to systematically destroy the Anglo invaders, I finally had my city back. I was given a hero’s welcome. But where was my one true lover? Where was my beloved first wife? Miryam? She must of been mothering my children, as she was good at. The marble steps of New Zeruko were much more comfortable than the sands of the siege camp. I am not a man for speeches, but my generals pressured me to give a small speech. I assured them that if we can beat the Anglish, the Norse, we can surely conquer the french coast land. Going to the open air court room that my ancestors had sat on for ages - well, except for that Elida, who thougth she was Carthage with larger mammaries. Then again, she founded this city as well….ENOUGH of my idle musing.

I was greeted by my straight faced daughter. “Darling child, where is your mischievous smile?” is what I said. I remember those words. She ran off crying. Then I saw the open casket. [Oh...I….] (http://i.imgur.com/3IwxD6r.png) still….can barely write about it, but what happened next was worse. Tayyurt stepped from the white bleached corner of the court smiling.

On the morning of Thursday, my close friend and marshal, Anzar dared to break the silence. Him and a small cadre of guards entered, with Tayyurt.

I still don’t care if it was the poison or my own hands that killed her. Only by Allah’s forgiveness did I let go of my anger. I write this, in a cold sweat in the early morn of twentieth. I intend to have her body quartered and her limbs sent back to the Idrisid Sultanate, whom I curse this day. Her head and torso are to be hanged in the entrance of my court.
People need a reminder of justice.

**1018, July 18, I’m out of here.**

I have decided to join my main army in Al-Andalus, in battle. A bloody escape from New Zeruko had left me and close to two thousand men scrambling to our Armada, and sailing for the main land. [Wish me luck.] (http://i.imgur.com/lXaIG9D.png)

**1018, December 29, my eyes.** 

I can not believe it. Brittany. The Bretons allied themselves with Aquitaine. Since my last update, we had conquered ALL of Narbonne, and Saisacc. Then a small force of Bretons attacked us. Filthy Kaffir!  Four thousand of them almost entirely destroyed our superior army of Six thousand. The third battle commences as I write this. To the battleline, I must go. [To the hell-hole, I must charge] (http://i.imgur.com/hYPQHXQ.png)

**1020-22, End of War...for one month.**

 I must write in brief what happened. I am mustering the army as I dictate this to my calligrapher.  The Hospitaliers came in the tens of thousands [or so it would seem,] (http://i.imgur.com/e0mORYF.png), and butchered  more than seventy of our holdings. I sailed from my refuge in Africa, after I had personally participated in battle for one year straight, I had to rest; to Al-Andalus. I signed my treaty personally, in the company of six army leaders, in the border.

Then one month later, on the same day, bad news came. [Bad news.] (http://i.imgur.com/3MwUAvz.png)

To keep face, I must answer the call to our Allies war. To keep my children’s land, I must wage war against the rebels. GREATEST, I PRAY that I do YOUR  will in this.

Then my son and law, who is coincidentally, my...tenth cousin, declared war on me. [Yeah, I am SO suited to be king.] (http://i.imgur.com/PVl09OM.png) I wonder now, if my Children will rule a country, or a little city state. 

Salvation from within - a side note added post mortem by the council - King Belasko the Kind had won the heart many people. He treated prisoners with courtesy, he released tehm, and he forgave his enemies. This had made him [popular] (http://i.imgur.com/u9wS3Yi.png) and helped win the campaign in north africa.

**1025 - Fueling my rage.** 

This year, I encountered three more wars. I say encountered lightly. Most of them were invasions, but one was a revolt...I finally secured my contract with the Bektashi, who are bound for the Ire-land and are currently battling the enemy. Sadly…[My joy died.]  (http://i.imgur.com/Uyv0xNm.png) It is hard to explain how much I HATED my son for dying. I did EVERYTHING FOR him. I did this to secure him an empire. And now he is dead. The healers say it is because of the curse of Nefferako; the weakness of our bodies which has plagued us since Anderkina, a weakness in the body. [On the other hand, the Bektashi served JUSTICE for me.] (http://i.imgur.com/vAfzhwg.png) And now my enemies army and holdings lay burning. My mother, whom I never knew well, died this year as well.

**1031, January 17- end of the bloody decade.**  There is so much I have missed, not keeping up with my journal. (((Out of character note: I DID record all of this with screen shots, but if I was to record all of 1021 - 1031, this would qualify as a short novella, something I doubt you would want to read.))) Today, I signed the last peace treaties.
All my foes have been trumped, trumped me, or I have allowed to escape. 

To fill in all descendants of mine, several things happened. Oxtoa, my son, was caught planning the mass murder of my family line, to secure a place on the throne. I exiled him to Viscaya. Now he lives with those like him - traitors. 

I have fathered many more children, and have married a beautiful Mande woman.

I am the adopted father of this [rascal] (http://i.imgur.com/ZPB79Fp.png) whose father died fighting for me in the wars. She has took after me, and is to be married to one of my sons, Greatest willing.

**15th July 1172**



 



We followed the retreating rebels for quite some time, killing off the stragglers, or the wounded who were left behind while the main army was running with all their might, hoping to avoid the fate of their fallen brothers.  They brought this on themselves, they were my men at one point, the ambitions of a petty lord caused their deaths.  Earlier today, we caught up with their entire army, and slaughtered every single one of them.  The death toll of just over a [thousand for the rebels](http://i.imgur.com/GoYirvr.jp ).  They have no army, no men to fight for them, how can they possibly hope to continue this lost cause?



 



**18th June 1173**



 



The war campaign continues.  It has been some time since I have been in a fight, I have been otherwise occupied.  Small dealings here and there, establishing alliances along the way.  I have spent almost a year with my wife and daughter since the slaughter at Asas.  My daughter is lovely, oh how she grows each and every day.  Although I have council members telling me about the war, I do not worry, the duke has no men, how can he possibly be a threat to me now?  But they are right, I must end this, I have ordered the armies of Syria to [amass outside the capital](http://i.imgur.com/clr09Wu.jpg) once again.  We will march to the lands of the traitor, siege the walls, and drag him from his pathetic castle.  It shall be a long march, but I must be there to see the man who has caused the deaths of so many.  My men have fallen in this rebellion, men I have grown up with, shared drinks with; I still see their faces when I sleep at night.  You can have all the sword training in the world, but war is something that you can never be prepared for until you experience it.  Although I do some day plan of carving out a kingdom, I must end this rebellion, and then march for Jerusalem.



 



**15th September 1173**



 



When the ally of Duke Wymund showed his ugly head, we were there to greet him.  3500 troops against 11 thousand.  We march to battle, and hopefully for the last time. 



 



I can see the army on the horizon, young men, scared, they didn't sign up for this, they have families that they will never see again, all because of the ambition of one man!  We march men, we run to battle, the last great battle of this foolish rebellion!



 



As battle commenced, I spotted a large man who was slaughtering my troops as they marched towards him!  Not any more I thought as I ran his way; After he was done fighting multiple men, he turned to me, as though he was aware of my presence the entire time.  “I've never killed a King before”, he said, as he readied his sword, “No”, I muttered back at this mountain of a man, “And you will not get the chance”.  It felt as though we were fighting for an incredibly long time, but in the end, my sword proved true.  As I ducked under the unwise swing of his sword, I quickly unsheathed my small dagger, and jumped on the man the second I could.



As I wrestled him to the ground, stabbing him as I go, I could see the life drain from his eyes.  As I stood up, victorious, and watching my men fight the enemy army with impressive strength and will, I heard a shout.



 



“Watch out, Your Grace!”.  It was too late, I turned around, [only to be smacked in the face by a large warhammer.](http://i.imgur.com/xfoCvjq.jpg)



 



**24th September 1173**



 



The battle of saint Symeon is over, [we have won](http://i.imgur.com/1Ndrwji.jpg).  But at a great cost, I, the king of Syria, have been injured beyond repair.  I shall wait out my days a bedridden and useless man, I am incapable.

My wife sat with me today, although I could not look at her, I understood all of which she was telling me.  My army moves for the [enemies capital](http://i.imgur.com/zcwM0yE.jpg).  I feel sad, so incredibly sad.  I will never have the chance to see my children grow older, never be their for their wedding, never be there to hold my grandchildren, never be able to make love to my wife.  This war, this war has stolen everything from me.



 



I am not long for this world.  I welcome death perhaps I will be reunited with all of the men that I have killed.  I deserve this.  I wanted to carve out the greatest kingdom the world has ever seen, and now, now I am destined to be forgotten, and be remembered as the man who lay in his bed, waiting for death.



 



**16th February 1174**



 



My wife sat with me again today.  I do love having her near me in my final days.  I have been lying here for months, unable to move, slowly moving towards the black gates of hell.  I am told that the rebellion is over.  The Hizirid Sultanate has seen fit to [steal the lands](http://i.imgur.com/JfHmrYt.jpg) that belonged to Duke Wymund.  I hope you are happy, Wymund, you landless filth, you have brought dishonor to the kingdom of Syria.



 



**6th March 1174**



 



My son sat with me today, I think is name is Henry, or is that my name?  Whoever he was, he told me that 16 thousand men are marching towards some place called [Jerusalem](http://i.imgur.com/ovt4k0H.jpg), to take back the holy land.  I didn't know what that meant, but he sounded happy about it, so I suppose I should be happy also.



 



**15th April 1174**



 



My life.  My whole life I have sought after glory, and in the end, I fractured the kingdom of Syria.  I am King Henry of Syria, and my death is near.  I can only hope that my son will not make the same mistakes that I have made, bring glory to the kingdom son, bring glory to the kingdo...

25mvy6,chisr5r,"The key to defeating the muslims is to destabilize them as much as possible before the jihads are triggered. Holy war the hell out of independent muslims, and look out for when the caliphate is undergoing a decadence revolt or shia caliphate uprising. During the revolt, declare a Holy War for land that will pretty much be uncontested while they fight the decadence revolt, then if the new caliphate is sufficiently weak, declare war on them as well. This might be unlikely because of leftover event troops from the decadent revolt, but it's still possible.

I managed to crush the muslims as the Armenian vassal of the Byzantine empire. I cut off fellow dukes from Holy Warring the independent muslim states and gathered them all under my vassalage. When the Shia Caliphate declared war on the Abbasid Caliphate for Mesopotamia, I had an uncontested Holy War on the Abbasid Caliphate because their forces were destroyed by the Shia. Then after the Shia carved out their own land, I declared war on them to take even more land. I triggered the Jihads when I retook Jerusalem, but that triggered the Holy Orders for the Orthodoxy, meaning gaining more land was even easier. Note, this is while I was still a vassal of the emperor, and not the emperor myself.

The only threat that ever came from the muslim world was when the Seljuks emerged and retook Mesopotamia, but they soon vied for independence after I managed to destroy most of the Seljuk doomstacks. Retaking those lands was simple. After getting most of Jerusalem and Mesopotamia under my rule as the Queen of Armenia, I finally was able to press my claim to the Byzantine Empire against a 5 year old empress. I defeated her and am now the Empress of the Byzantine Empire.

I, of course, executed the little girl before she could challenge me for the throne with her strong claim or bear heirs to inherit the claim.",4,4,0

The better solution though is to only fight Jihads when you're ready.  It's a bit gamey, but if you know what the actual triggers are you can avoid them for a while.  The fun only gets started if any of the following provinces are held by a non-Muslim: Jerusalem, Mecca, Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo, Marrakesh, Tunis, or Al Dzajir.  Tip-toe around those and you're safe.

Varangian Guard + retinues + 75 ""Defending against Infidels"" vassal opinion was enough for me to muster a force strong enough to smash the jihad stack by stack. I was outnumbered, but their troops arrived in trickles rather than as a single stack, and I moved swiftly to crush those stacks before they could reinforce.

You could see about trying to put a pretender on the throne of Bulgaria. Use de jure claim to seize their capital (it borders you initially), hold the province until a claimant is willing to join your court, give province to claimant, press their claim, gain entire kingdom at a stroke.

Any other ruler can generally declare war on you all the time, especially within the same de jure kingdom, and pretty much all tribal rulers have some kind of ambition to grow as fast as possible so all of their sons can inherit something. The further you go near the germanics, the worse it gets, eastern areas are harmless in comparison with the defensive pagan religions preventing tribes from eating each other with the same ease.

Generally in the tribal world, the big tribe eats the little tribe, and there is not much you can do about it if you begin as a small tribe other than follow the big one(if you even get the option) and break free after gavelkind succession fucks up the big tribe with the rulers death. 

If you do net get eaten within the first few years, raiding and building up your military buildings with prestige will make you a menace to everyone around you, as will collecting piety if you are a defensive pagan.

Also, martial is the only attribute you give a shit about for the first decades, nothing else.

8l6zhd,dzed5fb,"I normally play all-tribal worlds, so while I don't have a huge amount of experience with the game-in-large, I can share some secrets about how to start at the beginning.

* Choose a county where you have lots open land. Having a church/temple/bishopric there helps, too. The more open land = more levy size. My favorites are like Barcelona or Thessaloniki. Smyrna is good, too, as is Alexandria.
* Biggest thing: raid, raid, raid. Use your marshal to get raiders. Raid with them and your levies combined. Raid your neighbors, and get Shipbuilding ASAP if you are a coastal county.
* Build up your tribal capital with the prestige/gold you get from raiding.
* Raid some more.
* Have as few kids as possible, especially sons. Daughters are great for alliances.
* If you are playing Catholic, use your unwanted sons as heirs to the bishoprics (hence why you want them to start with), so they won't inherit land.
* Plan your conquests very carefully. Under gavelkind, you will lose territory as fast as your leader dies. Expand only when you can quickly go to the next level: Count -> Duke -> King. 
* Don't immediately invade when you get a claim -- only go for it when you: have enough claims to make a duchy/kingdom; can beat all the claims within a short amount of time; have enough time in your ruler's lifetime; have enough money to create the duchy/kingdom/etc.
* Keep raiding.
* Don't go feudal until all your counties are built up and will go feudal with you.
* Don't overbuild the counties -- check to make sure the buildings you are making in tribal will translate to feudal buildings when you go feudal. Usually, it's one every two: Market Town = nothing in feudal. Market Town II = Castle Town.

Probably some other things I'm leaving out. I'm still trying to balance where I should go feudal, and when. I'm usually able to go feudal (starting with Rise of Islam 633 AD) sometime in the early-to-mid 700s.",1,1,0
8l6zhd,dzeedke,"Dont be catholic for one, it pisses off your slavic neighbors. The real trick is to abuse prestige troops,for every 500 prestige you can raise 2500 troops, for every 200 piety you can raise 2000 troops in DEFENSIVE wars only.

So basically as soon as you get 500 prestige you might as well subjugate your nearest weakest neighbor (someone who recently depleted their levies.)

NEVER fight the horse lords, cavalry armies annihilate light infantry even when  its 2 to 1. If a Khan wants to make you a tributary accept it, they will be allies that you pay for, they never refuse to come help you in war and you dont suffer a prestige penalty to refuse a call to war from them.

6f3o8x,dif8gy1,"The issue is the new secret religious societies thing. It actually isn't that difficult to deal with, but it does make us play differently than we used to.

I'm guessing you demanded a lot of conversions? Under the new patch, that's a risky thing to do, as people can now do phony conversions, pretending to observe the new ways while continuing to practice the old ways in secret. Worse, they can organize, practicing in secret while plotting to overthrow the new ways.

I would say recruiting is a bit too easy at the moment (though I have observed that it is considerably more difficult with low diplomacy characters than one might assume). I also don't agree with letting unreformed pagans organize secret societies (I don't see unreformed paganism as being sufficiently united in stories and doctrines to work that way; the reformation *is* that process of standardization and unification). 

But I do think the new mechanic adds well to the narrative, and it is easy enough to avoid, even in its current iteration. Don't ask your vassals to lie to you, and they won't. ""Demand conversion"" is just that: a demand, with consequences implied. It's a quick and easy path to religious unity... but it's a false unity, and long term it creates more problems than it solves. Better to take the slow path, the righteous path, of slowly converting through peaceful argumentation (which is to say, send your chaplain). And if you just have to have someone with the right religion in place, don't tempt the existing vassal to lie to you. Just enable religious revocation and replace him.

3aw6kl,csgva22,"Really, you should have prepared for this earlier. Build market villages in your demesne starting in the provinces with the most empty holdings, which easily nets you plenty to upgrade and construct new hillforts for your vassals and yourself, as well as allowing you to enlist a mercenary company without going negative. 

Forging alliances with large neighbors is a must, as they'll be your pillar during the transition when an opportunistic neighbor inevitably declares war. From the looks of it, you have a large enough dynasty to send out daughters to surrounding kingdoms to back you in wars, as well as preventing them from attacking you. 

Ensure that your vassals have all positive opinions of you, and if there are negatives, a gift can easily skyrocket their opinion of you. Keep a close eye on the factions tab after you convert to note those troublesome vassals involved in several plots, and be sure to send a gift their way to eliminate faction power. 

Doing these three things made my adoption of feudalism relatively smooth, with only 2 counties revolting which I easily put down, and a war from a neighbor I easily subdued in thanks to a well forged alliance. And incase you're wondering, I did this as the empire of Russia, so I was pretty much at your size, most likely larger.",1,1,0

I tested adapting feudalism with 5-10k cheated gold and it was enough to peacefully make the transfer.

Therefore I reverted my save, decided to raid my neighbours to get such amount of money, build lvl 2 towns everywhere i can and upgrade all duchy capitals (after my own provinces of course).

In a couple of years with around 60 years of age (prestige and opinion bonus to all) I took the decision to adapt feudalism. Thanks to my earlier efforts all of my enemies were fighting civil wars.

Additionally to secure extra funds I conquered Moldova and created a merchant republic duchy vassal (later I will probably imprison and kill him to get his stash of gold).

Right now I managed to advance crown authority in the very first days and earn more than 6 gold with all levies raised.

If no civil war springs out of nowhere (and seeing as most of my vassals rather like me and the rest are either children or in prison it is rather far from happening) I may consider the transformation a full success.

When you *do* have to holy war, try to use it on target duchies that are *in target countries* that don't directly border massive nations like the HRE and Byzantium.

It's a tough game, one you have to be supremely careful in handling. The HRE is a monster, and keeping it appeased until you united Sicily and Africa into a single kingdom should be your topmost goal. After you manage that, you should start acquiring adjunct territories such as Ireland. Stick two merchant republics up there, one in Ulster and one in Munster for the gold, then give all the other titles out either to other dynasts or give all of them to your chosen heir so he has a shitton of prestige/piety when he takes the greater throne. Other ripe targets for conquest include the Baleares islands off Aragon's coast, Cyprus/Crete if Byzantium is weak, Gotland if it's independent of Sweden/Sweden is weak, and Iceland if it's independent of Norway/Norway is weak. When you take those territories, set up merchant republics in them as well. Make sure your laws are minimum city levies but maximum city taxes. The gold you make from merchant dominance will go a massive way toward funding your expansion wars, even against a more centralized power like the HRE. Like a real merchant republic, by controlling so many vassal republics you can use their gold to make mercenaries your primary fighting force, rather than direct levies. From there just start going wild on the HRE's Italian territories, and gradually you'll become a strong enough central power that nobody can stand against you. From there, target the caliph of your religion (preferably you start Shia, so you can ally with the Fatimids early-game and have more holy war targets in Africa for mid-game) and war him constantly until he's landless. If he still holds the title of caliph (I don't remember if it survives on landless characters) kill his family members until it's destroyed.

Historically, this is actually what Venice and other republics did. No king is likely to break a big marriage alliance in return for some money.  

A thing, that always gives you an edge is your household. Always put money into upgrading it. Early, it gives you the advantage of a lot of trading post, but putting in money to those extra troops can mean a huge difference. It eventually becomes your own varangian guard.

I believe you can remove titles, fabricate treason, etc. just like feudal societies if you have the laws for it.

For you to revoke the citie i don't know exactly which crimes will allot u to take them or not, but i know that if u change relgions and got the heretical revoke reason you can get both those cities. So just have your chort chaplain do the mission that makes him heretic and change for a bit.

About trade posts, i don't actually build them besides the first one on venice. The reason why is if they get raided by norse they get destroyed and you fucked up an investement. Their prices are also insane if they are far away. I'd recommend building them on your holdings as time goes on.

Something weird about marriages that i noticed, is that if u go sunni you no longer pay for marriage, maybe this is a bug or i am wrong, but a sunni republic is overpowered so that migth be fun(no decadence and up to 5 wifes with patrician succesion rules).

Conquering the balkans is probably the best you can do, while spending money on building cities in your holdings. After you get decent size kingdom, i would recomend swapping your cities for castles(with atleast 5 vassal mayors) cause at that point you already have all the money you want and the extra retinue by castles is nice.",-1,-1,0

3arv9a,csff7i7,"Yes, raiding is OP and I'll tell you why I think so. 

**Stage 1:** Imagine you're a count in Tribal Ireland. You set your marshall to raising a raiding party and eventually he does. You then raise all your troops along side it so you have say 600 troops. You run around raiding every one of the counties adjacent to yours so you get a cut of everything (choosing a county with lots of bordering counties helps here) and because you're always stealing their gold they never get a chance to upgrade anything whereas you're getting gold and prestige from all the raids. 

**Stage 2:** Eventually (you'll probably need to lower and then raise your levy again to make sure it's at full power) your county is upgraded to the point that as well as raiding the counties in Ireland you also siege them. Now you can raid the counties which aren't bordering yours and still get gold from it. Raid everything constantly, make a fortune, upgrade more.

**Stage 3:** Declare a subjugation war on a county that belongs to the duchy your county belongs to. So if you started in Dublin you raid Cail Dara because they're both de jure Meath. Remember, you've raided these guys constantly until their village is in flames so they can't raise any troops. You win easily. Now you have two counties within the same duchy. Make the duchy for a 50% bonus to troops in your capital and a 25% bonus in the other county plus all the other benefits. Rinse and repeat until you're the King of Ireland. Then turn your greedy eyes toward Britain.

Doing things this way it's very easy to become the most powerful man in Ireland very quickly. I've also done this in Scandinavia. Because of the sheer size of the place it was a little slower going but it worked eventually. ",1,1,0

Muslim Invasions simply vassalize all titles lower than the invading party, so you were lucky -after a fashion- for not having formed Syria, as this would've made you unlanded instantly.

There's no real value to creating further kingdoms right now, you want every available penny. Finish off the Bolghars and Cumans as quickly as possible, consolidate the conquered lands with a focus on squeezing every last penny out of your kingdom. Once on a secure financial footing fill out your retinues (unlikely to be a lot), hire the three 100 gold horse archer mercenaries (Alans, Pechnegs & Cumans companies I believe) and drive south, focusing on Muslims only.

Horse Archers get ridiculous bonuses to both combat and assaults. Hurl them against the walls of every castle you encounter and they'll pay for themselves while reducing their own maintencance. Use levies when needed but the advantage of the merc/retinue band is that you can mobilize immediately. Just keep going, focusing on rapid invasion, not a slow expansion.

Build and develop a strong personal domain. Hold as many counties as you can without suffering from being over your domain. Focus on economic buildings first. By having a strong personal domain, you can support a large army. Invest into MAAs. The exact composition is up to you but you want siege weapons to speed up sieges. 

Prepare well for succession. Get know thyself to know when you’ll die of natural causes one year in advance. Make sure your heir has decent diplo and few sinful traits. If your heir sucks, get rid of them by: force him to be a knight, force him to vows, imprison and execute. When your health is poor or you’re old, focus on just saving gold. Only use gold to make some MAAs. 

When your heir takes over, always do the following. Appoint your powerful vassals to your council unless they’re absolute garbage. Host a feast for opinion, set spymaster to disrupt schemes, and martial to increase levy size. You want the powerful vassal who likes you the most as your spymaster. You can kick them off your council later. 

Start people asap focusing on your spymaster, realm priest, spouse, and powerful vassals. You can do internal alliances to hard block vassals from factions or external to call them defensive wars. Hover over the vassals in factions opinion of you. Find out why they dislike you and fix it if you can. Granting land might not be enough because there might be other things. Are you above the domain limit? Are you of a hostile faith? Do you hold too many duchies? 
 
Diplomacy is crucial to holding empires together. If you’re Greek culture, pick the Just trait if you can as it grants extra diplomacy per level of fame. Befriending is powerful as a hard block against factions. Thoughtful to increase opinion from gifts. The overseer branch from the martial lifestyle is also good. It has perks which increases the threshold for factions to fire, increases you control over counties, etc…  you can choose to be feared by executing or torturing people. However, vassals with the Brave trait won’t be intimidated by you. 

Factions might still fire. If you’re dealing with multiple factions, go for white peace. Find out who the war leader is and siege their capital. That should be enough for a white peace. If not, siege down some more counties. Those vassals will be hard blocked from factions for 5 years. However, you have an imprisonment reason against all those vassals. Wait for your strength to build up and arrest the strongest members one by one. Revoke their titles. Call allies in if you have to. You might get lucky in that you can ransom some prisoners. If you’re in a lot of debt, it might be better to just ransom your vassals. You",3,3,0
12348ko,jdt5v42,"Seems like you built your empire on a weak foundation.

You need a strong personal domain, really good economy (150g/month or more) and a full maxed out army of heavy infantry and/or cataphracts, all buffed as much as you can. And a few k gold for emergencies.

Also keep your dread between 90 and 100, you have access to castration and blinding. Do that. Terrified vassals don't join factions. Keep at last 10 prisoners for when you die, so your heir can instantly max out dread.

If you don't have all of that, you should probably stay small and set up your realm better. Don't create too powerful vassals, ally with those who are powerful, have a grand court for extra opinion, and don't hand out titles, because people are never satisfied. They'll want more.

Play tall until reaching Partition.

Asatru has the added benefit of Concubines, so if you want to secure that Heir and start a Eugenics program.

You drop the Concubine but keep the heirs upon switching to Christianity.

I suggest doing the Unify Italia first. It grants Man at Arma, Pike Columns and Guilds.

Which is incredibly stong, having 3 High medieval technology in Mid. 

With Sanctioned Loopholes, buy the Byzantium Empire title before making Italia. 

When completing Partition in Mid medieval, use hooks to force it on your Vassals. Pass it as your law as well.  This way when they die, their main title doesn't split. This will keep a United Kingdom and Empire.

Then its just throwing lots of Feasts and keeping Vassals happy. 

If your Vassals are Allied with you through marriage, they cannot join Factions. 

With the mass Piety you have saved as a Pagan through Raiding and war, and in the Theologian skill tree to lower Reforming costs. You should have enough to pass all laws first time through.

That is, until he sent his daughter to the visigoth king Roderick's court for safety, only to later discover she had become pregnant with his child.

She claimed she was raped by him whilst bathing, something muslim chroniclers of course agree with. Spanish chroniclers claim she was a temptress who seduced Roderick. Either way, count Julian believed his daughter and rage-quitted. 

And by ragequit, I mean he surrendered his army and fleet to the muslims, and offered to lead the muslim invasion of spain in his own ships as revenge against Roderick.

**7 December 1074**

I have kept court at Tyumen for three months. I allow my generals to do my work for me; there are plenty of pagan nobles to torment here in the Tyumen capital.

Horns call out; my soldiers return en masse. On the battlements of Tyumen I see that my generals are accompanied by none other than the High Chief of Tyumen himself, the fiery-eyed Begluk.

""My lord!"" calls a herald from below. ""Begluk and your steward, Uzluk, have negotiated a peace settlement. He will end this war, and abandon his claim to our lands, if only we will restore his citadel to him.""

We swear to peace at the gates of the city. My men withdraw, loot and captive women in tow in the wagons behind them. His city returned to him, Begluk and his retainers trot on horseback into Tyumen, their helds hung low with shame. My generals wish to return to Bulgar at once - we have been long far from home - but I beg them to stay. I tell them that I have a special surprise for them.

The men wait restlessly, chattering among themselves. Someone in the ranks cries out, pointing to the walls of Tyumen. Tendrils of black, oily smoke rise in thick curls from one of the quarters of the city. Suddenly, there is a deep and powerful explosion. The ground vibrates beneath my feet, and a section of Tyumen's city walls collapses. Uzluk turns to me, agape. His expression makes me laugh.

""Don't look so surprised, Uzluk. You don't think I'd give up the city without having a little fun first? I set fire to stores of manure I hid across the city. Begluk can keep his little castle.. what's left of it, at least.""

I signal for the men to march. We turn to the northwest, to home. As we depart, I see Begluk on the battlements, screaming curses at me through a brass speaking trumpet.

Weeks later, when my men and I arrive in Bulgar, the people welcome us with a great festival and parade. While making a speech in the city square at the end of the evening's banquet, I formally crown myself as Duke of Cheremisa. The Cheremisa belongs to the Mordvins no more; I must adopt this title to secure my legal right to the territory.

[**21 April 1075 - 30 March 1076**](http://i.imgur.com/2V4fxAmh.jpg)

Rule from Bulgar bores me. I am only content so long as I have pagans to torture; regrettably, the few I had on hand in my dungeon have all perished from blood loss or illness. I need new victims!

An opportunity presents itself during a session in the Black Chamber. The assemblymen agree: our noblemen have been at home for too long. They are accustomed to the life of war and blood lust that I have provided. They yearn to bring the word of God to more of the heathen lands that surround us.

""The weakest of our pagan neighbours is Sarin, [High Chief of the Samoyeds](http://i.imgur.com/TW2G318.jpg), my lord,"" an assemblyman shouts. ""If it please your grace, we should march our men north to subdue them, to drive them from their lands, and to subjugate them beneath our heels. And, of course, if your grace wishes to administer those new lands effectively, I am certain that members of this assembly would gladly take stewardship of the lands on your behalf.""

Typical. Lesser nobles always scrabble for more. It is to my advantage to conquer pagan lands, however, and our forces are indeed mighty...

""Very well,"" I intone. ""Uzluk, go with the Marshal. Send word to the militia men. Let them know there will be more women and wealth for them in very short order.""

""Yes, my liege!""

Within days, our forces - twenty-five hundred strong - have gathered in the north of our realm. Fording a stream, we are surprised by the host of the Samoyeds with Sarin at its head. The Battle of Kungur is a Bulgarian victory; Sarin's forces, inexperienced against mounted troops, flee in disarray. Regrouping hurriedly on a low, distant hill, Sarin's men escape to the north.

My men and I follow behind Sarin's forces, rushing stragglers as we go. We march north - far north - to the very edge of the world. To my knowledge, [no Bulgarians from the Volga have ever seen such a place](http://russiatrek.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-white-sea-nature-russia-1.jpg).

The ground is cold and hard. It is covered in thin tufts of short grasses, mosses, and lichens. There are no trees to speak of, no birds, no visible animals. In this respect it is very much like the steppes that lie to the east, or to the open fields and plains within my patrimony. But there is water - a great water - a big water - stretching to the very horizon and in every direction. Large, thick sheets of white ice float slowly on the water's surface. I knew that a great water existed to the north of our lands, but I had no idea it was so impressive. The works of God are truly wondrous.

In the distant north I lose track of Sarin and his men. They have melted away into the grass and snow. Far from home and low on supplies, my men are forced to turn back. Marching south, we encounter a band of Samoyed troops. After entertaining myself with a few disembowelments, I learn from one of the warriors that Sarin has regrouped his forces and is marching south for his capital.

A lookout sights Sarin's host [near Veliky Ustug](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Veliky_Ustug.jpg), tired and weak from our long pursuit. We, too, are tired and weak, but God is on our side. In a long and arduous battle I am victorious! Sarin and his retainers are nowhere to be found, however. No matter; I will sack his villages and citadels until he is found.

My men lay siege to Verkh Mgla, the Samoyed capital. I will hold court here with my heir and First Wife until my generals have subdued the Samoyeds completely.

Let's hope my new father will be nice.

Let us hope she'll find happiness.

When need be, we could move our estates to their lands, and the d'Isigny line will live on 
Now all that is needed is for my to sire an heir.

Our celebrations will come in time, when the horde has been eradicated.

I have gotten word that my spymaster grossly underestimated the size of Hungary's army. If we are to defeat them in the field of battle, then we must hire mercenaries to bolster the flanks. I have enlisted The Alan Raiders, and even though their leader is an infidel, he is a great commander and the company is cheap to hire. We will win, we definitely will! Then they will see who the true craven is!

[**18th August 1205:**](http://min.us/lSZYUi7Iw3rOk) 

It seems that Hungary's armies outnumber us by 3000. But all is not lost, I am told the commanders behind Hungary are aggressive and foolish, they prefer to assault castles and lose many men rather than wait and starve them out. I have given the order for our horde to wait for them to whittle their numbers down. It's simply the best strategy, one that will lead us to glory! Also, the mercenaries have still not joined up with the main force. This is going to go well!

[**14th November 1205:**](http://min.us/lD9dU4fwaxaud) 

The army still waits, but my Imam does not. I have just gotten word that he has converted one of my vassals, Malusha of Gdov, the Sunni faith! I was not aware he was not Muslim, but it is good that we have one more brother among our ranks.

[**28th December 1205:**](http://min.us/lxKfJjL93SLlI) 

Today's diary entry consists of military matters, scholars and historians of the future. I have decided that I am sick of not being able to understand all the phrases and tactics being thrown about by my generals,when I sit in on my war councils. I am hereby going to be taught in military matters by my Marshall in his spare time. Perhaps, if it ever comes to it, I won't be such a craven and a coward if I am ever forced to lead an army. In other news, the Hungarian army has beaten itself down enough as to be weak enough for us to attack. We now march towards Chernigov where we will flank the Hungarian army, and then free the province. Death to infidels!

[**27th January 1206:**](http://min.us/lrP6BqHzWbzJ0) 

The fighting begins. I am worried, scared even, about the outcome of events. I have great trust in my commanders, and I know that my commanders are all more experienced than on the Hungarian side. With our horse archers, I know we will win.

[**4th March 1206:**](http://min.us/lbcgKSS7K4sKzv) 

I... I don't know how to write this down. I guess I shall have to. This is an important event in my families history. A shocking defeat at the hands of the Hungarians, despite innumerable odds. Twenty two thousand Rus' men have been slaughtered, all thanks to the blunders of our amateur commanders. My heart hangs heavy. Such a colossal amount of men being sent to heaven before their time. But Allah will treat them well. I have asked that every Mosque have religious services open all day every day for the next month in honour of the brave souls lost today. I am worried, though. How could such a thing happen, in our own lands? I am worried. It was so easy for them to crush our best, and now they advance on the stragglers. We are truly doomed.

[**10th May 1206:**](http://min.us/lbfpr8NRU7clpv) 

Today my vassal, Bey Ituk of Mordva, approached me and pleaded with me to release my brother, Prince Tunga, from my dungeon. It took a long time, but with careful words and great flattery, I was able to explain why I cannot release my brother, and I was able to have Ituk converted to my side of the situation. I have an inkling that he had a hand in the plots of my brother, but no matter. I will be kind. Kindness is needed in this year.

Not again...Not again! Just as I thought I was safe, I was proven wrong. I was enjoying a stroll through the palace garden with my friend, Kubasar, contemplating life and death, and the beauty of heaven when I heard a whiz, then gurgling. I turned to see a dagger buried in my friends throat, as it gushes with blood like a fountain. I screamed and threw myself to the floor, and my guards rushed me to safety. As we were running inside, I saw the assassin, robed and dressed like the Hashshashin, scurrying over the palace walls. I have ordered a city wide search for the assassin, and doubled my guard once again. I know it's the treacherous King of Hungary. The tides will turn for them, Allah is my guide.

Yesterday, I was sparring with my partner, trying to increase my understanding of fighting, when he swung too low and I could not block fast enough. He swung too hard and instead of causing a bruise, the sword cut straight through my leg, dismembering it at the shin. The devil responsible for this has been blinded and castrated, and is awaiting public execution in a week. The fever is too much, I cannot say more. I feel like I am going to die. Leave me, now. Thank you for writing my words. You can stop now, you blustering idio

I woke up two days ago from a deep sleep. Apparently, I was found collapsed in my study, head buried in this book. I can barely eat, and writing is taking all of my strength. I got word today that 7000 more of our men have died in another battle. I half wish I died in the deep sleep. According to my doctors, it is natural for my body to do that after such shock. I must sleep now, I am so tired.

[**19th December 1206:**](http://min.us/lMJCo0jpi5140) 

With all that has happened, I have neglected my sons education. He is six years old now, and it is customary that he begin being taught in the ways of diplomacy, war, money and murder. I have decided that I am strong enough to educate my son myself, as I am strong enough to speak at length. My foot still blazes hotter than the fires of hell, but I must be strong for my son. I don't want to die.

[**28th December 1206:**](http://min.us/ll6WeGIsxMp5v) 

Another daughter. Does Allah laugh upon me, and think me a fool? I have only been blessed with two sons, one a bastard. Another daughter in a string of bad events. What have I ever done to anger the lord? We have named her Gunduz.

[**4th January 1207:**](http://min.us/lB3qchyzX7i88) 

The army is gone. The entire horde, every single man, dead. Now the Hungarians lay waste to my lands, unstoppable in their raiding. Why did I ever start this war? I was content with my lands. I thought that the war would bring glory and honour, but it has only brought sadness and hate for my rule. I wanted the people to love me, now they laugh at me.

[**22 February 1207:**](http://min.us/leaygcD5MWzze) 

I have decided to spare my people more suffering, and surrender to Hungary. The deal includes me paying a large 800 pieces of gold to Hungary for their war efforts, and great shame upon my family. I am truly the worst Abdeddit to ever rule. I'm sorry, my son, if you ever read this. I have left you surrounded in a sea of enemies, with the throne in debt. You must bring glory back to the Abdeddit name. For the sake of Allah.

[**10th March 1207:**](http://min.us/lbvt85QK77AGM6) 

Usury is a sin. I know this, yet I commit it. It is a personal sacrifice I must commit in order for the throne to rebuild. I owe great debt to the Hungarians and to my friends, and I am scared of once again invoking the wrath of the Hungarian devils. I have taken a loan of 200 gold for five years from various banks and money lenders.

[**22nd May 1207:**](http://min.us/lHQLwPd4n7lzF) 

I fear my time is near. I have failed my ancestors, I have failed my father, I have failed my children: but ultimately I have failed myself. I have made a mockery of the Abdeddit name, turning it from something to be feared to something to be laughed at. I have not lost any land, but if I should die soon, I will leave my son in a terrible position. I am a cripple and courtiers snigger behind my back. My entire life I have been a coward and a craven, and through trying to disprove what is true I have led to the death of thousands. I'm sorry, peasants.
I'm sorry son.

I have left you in a bad position, one that will probably lead to the fracturing of the empire. Not only this, but the coffers are damn near empty and you are a very young boy. My advice would be: don't fight the Hungarians. I thought I was strong enough to face them, but apparently not. Move south, and expand down there. You shouldn't take much advice from me, but that's all I have to say. I'm so sorry it ended up like this. I love you dearly. Your hardships will only lead to a harder ruler. Be smart, stay alive. Don't fight Hungary, fight Poland. Spend your money making people like you, you're going to need it.",4,4,0

5owx5g,dcngoai,"Increasing the difficulty level [gives AI rulers bonuses to morale](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Warfare#Game_Difficulty) and income. The AI morale bonus seems like it would make the game *more frustrating* more than it makes the game harder. The AI income bonus seems like it would unbalance the economy while making it *easier* to gain massive stockpiles of cash by seizing it.

I don't recommend increasing the difficulty level. If you need a challenge, impose restrictions on yourself, like:

* Don't hire mercenaries, except to match enemy use of mercs.
* Don't call allies to war unless you have the same liege or are both independent.
* Don't break betrothals if you have used the betrothal to call an ally to arms.
* Don't intentionally educate kids as infidels in order to holy-war or revoke from them later.

Or forgo the overpowered continuity of your realm's rule, by selecting a new dynasty member to `play` as after succession:

* Someone who becomes landed at least 20 years after your previous character's death (using `observe` between generations)
* Someone whose tier is count
* Someone who inherits a hidden gene from your first character

I used the first two for a while, and am trying the third in my current game.",4,4,0

5btzh2,d9rfzk2,"I’d start over and consider this a practice run.

If the goal is a Norse Germanic World Dominion, a successful Sigurdr start should *at minimum* have reformed the faith and gained control of de jure Sweden and Denmark before Sigurdr dies (typically you want to reform the faith by 780 and have a solid 40-holding Kingdom with no strong rival nations by 785, so you can get some proper raiding done before the Viking Age kicks off).

Ideally, you’ll have either created, conquered, or be in the midst of conquering a suitably large empire by the time of Sigurdr’s death. I typically vary between Scandinavia, Empire of the Fylkirate, or one of the Roman Empires, depending on my mood, but Germania or Britannia work just as well, and I’ve heard good things about Arabia if Sigurdr’s got high enough Diplomacy and Martial and you can get close enough to launch an Invasion.

That said, it’s rarely too late to fix things, so you might want to explore the current game a bit more to see how recovery can go.",3,3,0

5btzh2,d9svwcj,"Thanks to those that responded.  I ended up playing longer to see what happened when I got the empire back.  Of course, succession of the empire switches from me to my heir (NBD, right?) and I get the depressed trait, so I figure I am all set.  However the emperor ended up dying and my son took over the empire.  Then I died (naturally) and took over as my son.  

Somehow, he had managed to become feudal despite being unreformed Germanic.  I inherited a war to conquer Denmark (which would have been my 1st item of business anyhow), but I'm way weaker than I was as tribal and half my vassals are still tribal.  Most of my demesne was tribal.

Then the Pope launches a crusade for Saxony, which I own.  I got spanked and converted to Catholicism (should have sieged Rome instead of fighting straight up).  I won the claim war, so my threat went over 50%.  I'm currently trying to consolidate power in Scandinavia, upgrade all the tribal holdings to feudal, and kick out the remaining Germanic lords.

1gz22y,capajvd,">By far the most fun thing to happen in this playthrough (other than Tengri Carpathia becoming bigger than the HRE and the Byzantines combined are in a normal 1066 start) was a stray kinsman of mine – a proper Rurikovich who just happened to be Norse/Norse – triggering a prepared invasion on Sarkel, marching across Russia with his 17K doomstack, conquering Sarkel, then Cumania and in the process marrying a Slavic woman and converting to the Slavic faith. So, in the end, I ended up with this huge buffer zone to the south that is controlled by a member of my dynasty and of my own faith. Sometimes it’s a boatload of fun watching the AI do its thing.

This is a problem for all the pagans.  None of the norse households seem to have a lot of women hanging around.  I've found myself introducing debutantes (which is a funny way to describe a viking lady honestly) for the first time.  Fortunately it's pretty cheap when you're a small viking lord.

I love the new invasion mechanic.  I even had one of my brother's invade me, and it was awesome fun.  His force was about the same as mine so I thought it was a fair fight.  Way more fun than mongols.  I also love the new peasant and liberator revolts! Such a good expansion.

One thing you haven't mentioned is that anytime you're not warring, you should be raiding!  Pick a neighbor and keep everything he owns pillaged.  Then when you're ready, snag one of his counties, and then go back to pillaging.  As long as he's weaker than you, he'll never even engage your main stack, and you can just wander around obliterating him and keeping him weak.  Not to mention enriching yourself with gold and prestige, and stealing all his women.",1,1,0
1gz22y,capcsut,"I just tried this start last week, and I found it really hard.

You do start fairly large, and Rurik has good stats, but I found that as I expanded and gained more vassals, it became really hard to manage them.

Being stuck in low crown authority with gavelkind, and being Norse when most of your vassals are Slavic meant that my first succession crisis tore me apart.  My vassals hated my new ruler so much that they just started revolting constantly and then the neighboring dukes/counts piled on and declared subjugation wars against me.

What am I doing wrong?  I never really had enough money to send assassins after my kids so I only had one son as an heir, and despite bribing my vassals, there were always a few who hated me and just constantly revolted.  I never had these problems be so difficult with Christian rulers.",1,1,0
