11a5948,It pains me how unpolished this game is,"For context, I have played this game on and off and have over 1000 hours. Obviously I like the game. My problem is that there are problems that feel like a modder could fix them, which is why I mostly with mods and also make my own mods. 

I realize that there is a stereotype of a Paradox fan that plays for hundreds of hours and then goes on to complain about the lack of depth. My complaints are indeed about depth, but I admit the game has a lot of breadth. 

When I talk about a lack of polish, what I mean is that when a new DLC releases and you get a new feature to play with, there's often something wrong with it. That's not a big problem because you can always fix them, but a lot of the time that just doesn't happen.

Let me give an example from when the Friends and Foes update was released and gave us the memory system. I started a campaign and eventually found that my oldest son was not my heir. This was something I had missed. To be fair, the game gives a notification when that happens, but it's easily missed. That's my first problem, notifications. The game pauses everytime someone schemes against a rando at your court, but not for when **my oldest son became a Eunuch**. That's why he wasn't my heir. I also found that he had sired a bastard son, which I had also completely missed. I looked at his memories and **he had no memories of the birth of his only son - or having his dick cut off**. 

The Friends and Foes DLC also expanded on rivalries. Nice, except you still don't get, say, a special casus belli when **a random tribal heathen kidnaps and rapes your wife and daughters**. That just didn't make the fucking list. You can get a house feud when someone from your hourse is murdered, which is good, but **murder is only a crime if it's against your close family**, so at most you can murder back. I tried murdering various Islamic houses into nonexistence but every ruler has 3 wifes each so good luck with that with your maximum 1 hostile scheme. 

Fate of Iberia added the Rite tenet 9 months ago and the result is that the Pope can call separate Crusades for your new faith that instantly fails because that's not his own faith. Speaking of Crusades, you don't get notifications if you aren't Catholic or a defender, and once you have conquered the core Christian regions he starts picking targets that are months away from any Christian realm. In my last game a crusade for Persia was followed by one for central China and Japan, and if you don't play with a modded map he still really likes to go for distant lands like Pagan and eastern Tibet. 

Speaking of the Pope, there's literally a decision to humiliate and/or crucify him but if a Caliph ever becomes your vassal you can't even revoke his titles because he's a temporal head of faith and he needs land. 

I could go on and on with this, because I keep running into features that scream ""Mod me"". It's just tiring at this point and I don't think I will be buying future DLC unless the dev team steps up their game.",146,146,0,-0.4215,0.0,0.714,0.286,-0.9945,0.098,0.737,0.165

rpliqa,A conversation with my marshal (2),"***Marshal:*** The war effort us going excellent my liege, we now control over 50% of the enemy's territory.

**King**: Splendid, soon Aquitaine will be once more part of the French empire.

&#x200B;

***Messenger***: My king, news from home, viking raiders are attacking our chores.

**King**: Those damn savages, how do they even know when to attack, knowing our armies are busy in the South, where do they get their intelligence?

***Marshal***: My king, the proclamation of this war has of course been sent out to all known rulers to back up the legitimicy of your claim to the throne.

**King**: Really? Sharing such vital information with potential enemies doesn't seem like a goed idea... Anyway, those poor villagers up North can't be helped, we have to focus on our enemy in the South first.

***Messenger***: They're not just attacking villages Sire, they're marching on the capital.

**King**: Goddamn savages, alright then, Marshal gather our troops, we'll chase these vikings off our shores first, then return to Aquitaine when they're all dead or fled.

&#x200B;

***Messenger 2***: My king, bad news, the raiders have sacked the capital and kidnapped your wife and queen.

**King**: My beloved wife! Marshal we need to hurry, we should be able to catch them before they board their ships.

&#x200B;

***Marshal***: My king, we caught up to the enemy and were victorious in battle, the last remaining raiders are fleeing and we reclaimed all the gold and valuables they stole.

**King**: What about the prisoners?

***Marshal***: We made quite a few prisoners of war Sire, they've been transferred to your dungeons.

**King**: Not them, the prisoners they took, where is my wife?

***Marshal***: They didn't have prisoners with them Sir, they took them to their capital in Sweden.

**King**: What? When?

***Marshal***: After they raided our capital, my king.

**King**: But we stopped them before they could reach their homeland.

***Marshal***: Yes we did, we stopped their army, it was a glorious battle.

**King**: Then how did the prisoners get away?

***Marshal***: They were already back at their capital, Sire.

**King**: But how? They didn't teleport there, did they?

***Marshal***: ...

**King**: Fine, arrange a ransom with their king and get our army ready to march back South.

&#x200B;

***Messenger 3***: My king, the viking king refused your ransom.

**King**: Why... That bastard.

***Messenger 3***: He also took your beloved wife as a concubine.

**King**: Goddamnit. Alright, that's it, I'll make peace with Aquitaine for now and get my wife back by force.

***Court Chaplain***: My liege, she is no longer your wife.

**King**: What? Why are you here? What are you talking about?

***Court Chaplain***: I came to tell you, your ex-wife was taken as a concubine by a pagan king. This means that in the eyes of God you're officially no longer married. You have no obligation to go and save her.

**King**: You're all crazy, of course I will save her, I love her.

***Court Chaplain***: Of course Sire, but before you do, you should consider marrying someone new, it's not right for someone of your position to be unmarried.

**King**: Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?

&#x200B;

**King**: Marshal, prepare us for war with this viking kingdom in the North. 

***Marshal***: Of course, Sire, which Casus Belli should I quote?

**King**: We're going to free my wife.

***Marshal***: That's not a real Casus Belli, my king.

**King**: I don't care, you think of something.

***Marshal***: Of course, my liege, how about a holy war? They are pagans after all.

**King**: Great, as long as I get my wife back...

***Marshal***: You mean the enemy's concubine? She resides at the capital, a holy war for the kingdom should give us the greatest chance of success.

**King**: Fine.

&#x200B;

***Marshal***: My king, it's been almost a year, our troops are exhausted, but we are finally victorious, the enemy capital has fallen, the viking king has surrendered. You are now not just the king of France, but the king of Sweden as well.

**King**: Finally, I will be reunited with my wife.

***Marshal***: You mean the concubine, Sire? After her king's surrender, he lost all his titles. His courtiers and concubines moved to his brother's court, a duchy up north.

**King**: What? Why wouldn't she stay and be reunited with her beloved husband?

***Marshal***: She is no longer your wife, my liege.

**King**: But why would she move to a random duke's court?

***Marshal***: Not random my liege, he's the brother of the man who made her his concubine. That's where her duties lie.

**King**: But she was forced into that position, surely no-one would expect her to remain loyal to the people who kidnapped and raped her?

***Marshal***: ...

**King**: Goddamnit. So is she now this duke's concubine?

***Marshal***: Just his courtier, Sire.

**King**: So she is free to leave if I invite her to my court?

***Marshal***: The duke dislikes you my king, he won't let her leave.

**King**: Marshal, prepare our troops.

&#x200B;

*- one generation later-* 

***Marshal***: And that my boy, is the story of how your father, once king of France, became the emperor of all of Scandinavia, and you now rule this frozen wasteland rather than your warm, culturally significant homeland in the South.

ttp4dv,ck3 criticism,"It might seem controversial because I haven't seen many people bitch about ck3. I'll keep it short, ck3 is dumbed down. No amount of dlc can save shallow fundamental mechanics of base game. Personally, I grabbed ck3 after royal court dropped and found it not lacking but annoying and boring in many ways. 

1. My main problem is with technology and culture being intertwined. Rather than choosing a province or realm tech spread system which is far more interactive and less tedious than waiting for hard caps on when you can research something or not, they went for culture. Restrictive and slow not to mention completely stupid. For example, you are an English count in Gloster with Gloster being English and you have some Welsh land. Assuming you have the technology to build tier 2 buildings in your culture why can't you build them in your own Welsh land? Do you and your court and people suddenly forget everything about those techs when walking off the English culture lands? Is it dark magic? Do you have to kill all your architects when you cross between different cultural borders? Fortunately flogi's tech mod overhauls this bullshit and gives us that realm base system.

2. Events are too long, boring, annoying and repetitive. Specially in royal court, I don't give a shit about Teo random courtiers squabbling game. Why are there so many opinion related events popping up every good damn 10 seconds! Utterly useless in nature.

3. In ck2, there was a good point attached to sins like greedy giving you 10% more tax income. However in ck3  sins are only there to allow your stress bar not going too high after killing someone you killed your wife and children, raped and murdered your people and stole your land and money. ""But I'm a just character uwu"" shut up Timmy and kill that man without adding 2 levels of stress and dying a day after.

4. There are currently no realm wide laws other than crown authority. I like vassal contracts but I want some other laws which applies to all of the realm. 

5. Playing tall is possible in this game but if you want to be afk for the whole game because of technology and restrictive ways of adding development.

6. Why did they deleted ships from the game again? Ah,  yes, they were too complicated for newbies. Now, how do vikings carry their loot back, they must have huge buttholes.

**Edit**: removed a couple of stuff

Her father Ormr, a well respected warrior that had served chief Rognvald's father and now served him faithfully in Nidaros, was desperate for a child, but he and his wife Eyvor had very though luck, and now approching 50 years of age, the chances of giving birth to a heir were slim. Nevertheless, her mother prayed to Freja every night, offering to the goddess even her own flesh in exchange for a kid for his beloved husband.

After an year, they found a reason to rejoy: Eyvor was pregnant! The woman's belly grew and grew, and on a cold winter night, the baby was being born. However, the childbirth was complicated, and the poor Eyvor suffered from heavy blood losses, that caused her to die within a few weeks. Ormr found himself alone with a newborn child, and went above and beyond to give her the best life he could.

The young Vigdis grew strong and beautiful, becoming rapidly famous in the chiefdom for her exceptional size, towering almost a foot among her peers, that convinced the old warrior that she could become a part of the chief's household, even though they were part of the lower classes, if she could prove her worth in battle.

Therefore, they trained and trained, one day after the other, and when she was sixteen, he petitioned to have her join the shieldwall. The chief was hesitant, but her abilities and peculiar phisicality won his favor, and so she was employed in the next raid.

Unfortunately, the raid went poorly, the raiding party was cornered, and to save his life, the chief fled on one of the boat, leaving most of the warriors behind, including Vigdis.

Vigdis fought desperately, and he and a few others were able to fend off the attackers and recover one of the boats, making their way towards home.

When they returned, and Ormr learned what had happened, he was furios, claiming that a chief that left for dead a girl that was placed in his custody was unworthy of his title, and challenged him for an Holmgang, to avenge his misdeeds. Being almost 70 however, he had lost almost all of his ability to fight, barely able to hold his trusty shield, and so the young giantess offered to take his place, saying that she would defend the Austmadr's name, even if they were just farmers.

The chief agreed to fight, thinking that a woman, while big, would not have a chance in a fight against a real man and warrior like him. Boy, was he wrong. She fought fiercely, parrying most of the man's blows and hitting his shield with the strenght of a dozen men, and before long, Rognvald yielded, a broken arm and an even worse spirit.

""I will spare your life, Rognvald, but you will have to leave Nidaros and never return "" she said ""If i ever see you again in these shores, i will crush your skull""

The ex-chief fled, leaving the town the next day, and given that his  only son had died the year before, the Assembly chose her as the new Chieftess, convinced that the gods had given her those qualities for a reason, and that her victory was the proof that she was the one to rule them.

And so she ruled, alongside her father, for a few months, until, at the end of a particularly cold autumn, the old warrior become ill with pneumonia, dying a few weeks later.

In his dying bed, she promised him that she would make him proud, that she would make their name great, and promised to her maidens that she would never allow a woman under her rule to be disrespected as she was, whatever it will take.

After an year, they found a reason to rejoy: Eyvor was pregnant! The woman's belly grew and grew, and on a cold winter night, the baby was being born. However, the childbirth was complicated, and the poor Eyvor suffered from heavy blood losses, that caused her to die within a few weeks. Ormr found himself alone with a newborn child, and went above and beyond to give her the best life he could.

Unfortunately, old Chief Rognvald was more interested in her other ""assets"", and when they embarked on a ship to raid in Ireland, the chief tried to rape her, and she was saved only by the sudden coming of an heavy storm, that the ship found itself in.

When they returned, and Ormr learned what had happened, he was furios, claiming that a chief that tried to bed a girl that was placed in his custody was unworthy of his title, and challenged him for an Holmgang, to reclaim his and his daughter's pride. Being almost 70 however, he had lost almost all of his ability to fight, barely able to hold his trusty shield, and so the young giantess offered to take his place, saying that she would defend the Austmadr's name, even if they were just farmers.

lp7tky,"A little CK3 rage for you all, enjoy the schadenfreude","So, a few months ago I made this post basically complaining that the game was too hard. At that point I'd played like 10 hours and was getting frustrated because I knew how nothing worked. Now that I've played for ten times as many hours...

I still don't have a god damn clue how anything works. But at least I'm (mostly) having fun. This game is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. No other game has made me feel these emotions. I fucked my brother's hot Greek wife, she had a son, I took him to my court as my ward, gave him a duchy, and he never knew I was his father. Needless to say my keyboard was a little wet after he died as some foreign asshole's prisoner. Disclaimer: I love this fucking game with a passion.

That being said, my main complaints are:

Educating heirs. I can have 30-something Learning and be doting over my Intelligent, Curious, Patient son who comes charging out of puberty with crayons in his mouth, barely able to read? I mean what the fuck? And my uneducated inbred 9th son will end up as an Elusive Shadow like, ""Fucking sike!"" and stab me in the head and kill me as soon as his balls drop out of his taint. It's funny when you're playing as the lunatic, feeble, hideous Emir Autismo ibn Abu-Cockmunch, but not so funny when you're King Fuck of Shit Mountain and you've got like 30 in every stat.

The war AI is very stupidly done and needlessly difficult.  War is the only thing in this game that makes me white-knuckle the mouse 100% of the time. You can be fighting Sheikh Babydick of the Vaginal Emirate who has 1000 levies, four knights, and a couple of cavalry divisions and when they see you coming they'll fucking book it, get on a boat and sail to India- and then your soldiers all die of attrition and they sail back and rape you. And for some reason, your allies always invariably huff a shitload of paint before battle or something and refuse to advance with you and abandon sieges at 999/1000.

Even when I'm attacking some dickhead with 2,000 soldiers and no allies, it's anxiety inducing as fuck because the AI is so annoying and they do shit like run in circles around a mountain or flee as soon as you start marching towards them, or suddenly their allies who were Pathetic in military strength show up with 10k dudes and smack the soap out of your hand.  The Papacy is especially bad about this and I hope it gets fixed. I understand if maybe Catholic rulers came to his aid, but the merc spam is so overpowered. I've literally attacked Rome with like 30k vs 6k and he'll somehow hire 50k mercenaries and immediately dickslap me.

Muslims are hard as fuck to play as, especially because the game forces you into partition for 3/4ths of the game. When I have four wives (and not taking four wives nets me a significant piety debuff), I can't not have 14-15 kids, half of them sons. You can't reasonably disinherit or kill most of them before they start squirting little assholes out of their cocks, so expanding past a kingdom into an empire so you have one dominant title for your firstborn to inherit is pretty much impossible. You never get far enough before you die. I repeatedly just give the fuck up on these saves after running in circles for decades trying to gain ground, it's pure horseshit. 

You can't even build tall and wait because every time you die there's a civil war and you have to go reclaim everything and spend years fixing your control again so your income is stable. As a Christian I can just request a divorce, or convince my one or two bonus sons to fuck off and go be monks or something. Islam: Born to Fuck, Forced to Give Away Land.

The fucking Byzantine Empire. I haven't played them, and probably will not ever purely out of spite. I thought they were stereotyped as a chaotic mess of civil wars? I've never had this happen in a game. They pretty much always blob out and end up controlling most of the map on an 867 start, it is supremely annoying. Minding my own business on the Horn of Africa and surprise! Basileus Assmaster IV is two yards away and has declared war on me with his dick already five feet up my ass. Every single time. I thought larger empires should be less stable and smaller empires should be more? Because it seems to be the reverse in this game.

Technology is way too hard to get. WAY too hard to get. I can have 40 learning and a 20-some stewardship Steward increasing development in my capital county (which always takes like 20 years to complete, making it even more useless) and it doesn't matter. I don't think I've ever had enough innovations to enter the next age when it began. I'm always getting assfucked by some German duke with mangonels on January 1st 900 while I'm sitting there jacking myself off waiting to get barracks.

o4myyd,Here is what I *love* about CK2,"I have had several playthroughs from the earliest start date to the end, and I have always come away completely awed by the narratives that unfolded. In my recent playthrough, I decided to document each and every ruler, and write a documentary of each one. Some rulers ended up having multiple chapters in my story, and I enjoyed rereading it so much that I put together a [timeline](https://imgur.com/a/bJRNKCc). The timeline was a labor of love, as I got to reread all my stories and remember the fun times. There are love stories, stories of betrayal, rape, revenge, intrigue, hubris, and gallantry.

If I were to write a book or a movie, I would be hard-pressed to choose which story to write about. Some of my top candidates:

- **Blessed Childebrand.** Starting from his visit as an 11-year-old to Lyon to try to secure a marriage to Bladovildis, the daughter of the Count of Lyon, he was passed over in favor of his older brother, the Duke of Toulouse, and, alas, poor Bladovildis subsequently led a short wretched life as his wife. A later betrothal to a Spanish Princess was also repudiated when Childebrand was arrested and imprisoned by his nephew, the Duke of Burgundy (who was, in fact, 9 years older than Childebrand). But Childebrand was charismatic, and he endeared himself to his captor and managed to persuade his cousin to not only release him unharmed but also agree to let him marry the duke’s daughter when she came of age. It was a good deal for both parties, as Austrechild would be a prestigious and powerful match for Childebrand, while the duke could be assured of the support of his troublesome vassal.
- **Ogier the Missionary.** Placed on the throne at the age of 7, early challenges to the child-emperor’s reign threatened to plunge the new empire (which had been established in the final year of his father's reign) into civil war. Ogier's council was staffed by the usual mix of malcontents and pragmatists who were looking out only for their own interests, and Ogier's only supporter, Gozhelm of France, died 2 years into the young emperor's reign. A serious plot to replace Ogier with his older sister, Sophie (who had 3 healthy sons), was thwarted by Duke Abram of Lower Lorraine and his half brother, Willichar, not out of love or duty to the emperor, but because Ogier was *their* puppet, and they wanted to keep it that way. For their role in uncovering the plot, Abram was promoted to King of France, while Willichar was granted a county of his own. When Emperor Ogier was 15, he fell in love with a 16-year-old noblewoman named Isabelle and he repudiated his promise to marry the 17-year-old Empress of Alba and fought a war for Isabelle's hand, the complication being that Isabelle was already married. He won the war (known as Isabelle's War) but never won her hand. At 17, Ogier was betrayed by Pope Leo IV, who encouraged him to go to war against Bavaria, privately hoping to bog him down in an unwinnable war, and then when Ogier started winning the war, the pope excommunicated him. Ogier would never forgive this betrayal (known as “The Great Betrayal”), and in response, he permitted heretics and fugitives from the Catholic Church to live within his empire. At this point also, Ogier came under the spell of an older woman Adaluildis (who had also been his father's mistress and confidante) and she took him to bed and mentored him in the ways of imperial rulership. At 20, Ogier finally found the woman he would marry. Bertenildis was everything Ogier was not; Ogier was a pretty boy Latin Frenchman, forbidden by law to lead troops (a rule implemented after the disastrous reign of Mad King Gedalca), while Bertenildis was a Frankish military woman, an inspiring leader to her troops, but not known at all for her looks. (One chronicler called her “homely.”) One can see, though, why a young man forbidden from military service might be taken by such a woman. Unfortunately, like Isabelle, the 16-year-old Bertenildis was married, but by lucky chance her husband would die under suspicious circumstances soon thereafter, and Ogier, with some difficulty, was able to persuade the young Bertenildis to join him on the Francian throne, granting her the title Queen of Crusader Aquitaine. Ogier had an active early reign, fighting first the Byzantine Empire for Germany, then pushing the Saracens out of Francia. (Bertenildis herself donned armor and led troops in the conquest of Rosello.) Plague spread through the empire the next year, followed by a revolt during which peasants forced their way into the imperial palace and attacked the young emperor in his bedroom. Ogier sustained a disfiguring wound to his face; the pretty boy would no longer be talked of as the handsome emperor. No rest for the still-young emperor, who, at 31, faced a serious civil war as the Duke of Gelre rallied half the empire to try to overthrow his rule and restore the power of the dukes. After 11 years of civil war, Ogier was able to finally suppress the rebellion, but he lost his wife in the process, Empress Bertenildis, who was assassinated by a ducal plot. Victory in the civil war, however, gave Ogier the strength to do what had long been suspected: he came out as Waldensian, in direct opposition to the Catholic Church. He used this as an opportunity to bring the defeated dukes back to his side: Waldensianism, he said, did not allow capital punishment; convert to Waldensianism, he offered, and he would spare their lives and let them keep all their titles. Unsurprisingly, most dukes took the offer, and as a result, he developed a lot of support for his opposition to the pope. After 7 years of peace, the enmity between the emperor and the pope finally boiled over, and Catholics and Waldensians all over Europe went to war with each other. In the end, Ogier found himself in control of Rome. Pope Nicolaus II fled, and Ogier declared himself King of Rome. To celebrate, Ogier remarried, marrying the devout Waldensian, Maddalena the Fair, who would be credited for the almost 40 years of peace that followed (“Maddalena’s Peace”). Alas, after a successful reign, Ogier's end would not be a pleasant one. A plot by secret Catholics led by the Duke of Thurgau and Prince-Archbishop Louis of Cologne resulted in his castration and subsequent death. Ogier’s reputation is complicated. Ogier singlehandedly destroyed the Catholic Church, and there is no doubt that Ogier strengthened the Francian Empire, but he severely depleted its treasury fighting a prolonged civil war. Hailed as a saint by many for overthrowing the corrupt pope, Ogier was despised by the many Catholics who remained in Francia. And, worse, his empire was split between his 3-year-old twin sons upon his death. (Tragically, all the sons Bertenildis had borne him had predeceased him.)
- **Léonard II.** Léonard ascended the throne under a cloud of suspicion, as he should never have been emperor had it not been for the untimely deaths of his brother and 2 nephews, one of which happened to have fallen to his death while Léonard was visiting Chalons. Léonard proclaimed his innocence and nothing could be proven, but he was exiled to Wales for 17 years before being recalled after Emperor André died. Even after taking the purple, Emperor Léonard sought to clear his name by launching another investigation into the death of Galasso III, but it was again inconclusive. Emperor Léonard sought to improve relations in the east and strengthen the few Christians out there by marrying his daughters to eastern princes, but both marriages resulted in disaster, with the fate of the younger (and most beautiful) daughter resulting in a national tragedy now called “The Rape of Elisabeth.” The Rape of Elisabeth resulted in a series of reforms throughout the empire to improve the position of women in society. Leadership and military service were opened to women, and a century later we see the rise of the great female generals: Helvis St. Abraham, Aude, and the greatest of all, Blanche. During his reign, Léonard continued the reconquest of Spain, and after the death of his first wife, Léonard married the young Scottish Princess Róis. Léonard, who had spent his exile in Wales and was familiar with British political intrigue, then arranged the murder of 6 successive Alban emperors and empresses in order to place his wife on the Alban throne, though by this time she had fallen out of favor and Empress Róis spent the first 6 years of her reign in a Francian prison. She would later go on to wear the British crown not once but twice and fight a generation-long civil war in Britain that would result in the final eradication of Roman Catholicism.
- **Diogenes II.** His two older brothers having died in The Plague (along with the revered Lavinia of Blois, a real-life Lyanna Mormont), Diogenes secured the right of females to inherit the Francian throne on the same standing as males. This was in response to The Plague, which had greatly depleted the royal family and could have resulted in a succession crisis and civil war had Diogenes himself not survived. Diogenes came of age in the post-plague years, when everyone was happy just to be alive. The Francian treasury was full, and the combination of youth and money resulted in lots of sex. His marriage to an eastern princess, Yildiz, didn't last, and she returned to her home in the east after being the subject of an argument between Diogenes and one of his mistresses, Duchess Thora of Gotland, who was jealous of the emperor's relationship with his own wife. Both Yildiz and Thora left (though Thora would return within a year), and Emperor Diogenes continued his affairs with numerous young women, most notably, the 15-year-old Patrizia. After having his marriage to Yildiz annulled, he married the absolutely stunningly gorgeous Hypatia of Dyrrachion. Unfortunately, Hypatia was not as libertine as Diogenes's court, and she refused to partake in his sex games. (She was also not happy when Empress Yildiz and Duchess Thora both bore him children after Hypatia's marriage to the emperor, and then Diogenes's 15-year-old ward Patrizia also bore him a child some months later.) Hypatia grew to despise her husband and refused him. On the last day of January, 1373, Emperor Diogenes invited the beautiful Hypatia to the catacombs, one of the palace’s many pleasure rooms beneath the castle, where he attempted to rape the beautiful empress. In the struggle, Hypatia stabbed the emperor to death. Emperor Diogenes was just 29 years old and had ruled as emperor for 20 years. He was succeeded by his young daughter Empress Valence, who would be raised by a trio of women: her mother Yildiz, Duchess Thora, and Vicereine Patrizia (who was not much older than the young empress, but who had been granted the Viceroyalty of Navarra on the birth of her daughter). All three would do a good job of protecting the young empress, and Patrizia (known to history as Patrizia the Unchaste) would become a close friend to Empress Valence. (Hypatia herself lived a rather awkward life after murdering her husband. With help from the court, she escaped back to Dyrrachion—she was never pursued—and she lived another 44 years in pseudo-exile. She never remarried or had children.)",14,14,0,0.6369,0.412,0.588,0.0,-0.9989,0.117,0.726,0.158
dh77a2,The single coolest dynasty in the game: The House of Ceuta (Qutids),"769 AD -  c*omes rei militaris* *of Ceuta*

Ceuta is the last remaining-some would say renegade- outpost of the Eastern Roman Empire's *comes Africae.* The *comes'* conquest was rapid with the Ummayad armies bursting through Egypt into North Africa in 697 AD. Roman-Visigothic African regiments fought alone against the Muslim advance for 14 brutal years as one by one they perished in the desert or starved in besieged forts. By the year 711 AD, with the other Byzantine Exarchs slain or exiled, Count Julian blocked the  Moorish army from crossing the Straits of Hercules into Christendom. 

Julian survived by aligning himself with the Visigothic usurper Roderic of Toledo. To prove his loyalty to the new *regnum*  *Ludharīq,* Julian sent his daughter to the Hispanic court to be educated as an alliance hostage. However, rather than sending aid Roderic raped her. Outraged, exhausted, and alone Julian made peace with the Moorish general Tariq ibn Zayad agreeing to ferry an Islamic expeditionary force across the strait. That army crushed the Visigoths at Guadalete three months later managing to kill almost the entire upper Hispanic aristocracy.

In return for his aid, the Moors granted Julian independent rule over Tangiers in which he lived the last thirty six years of his life utterly friendless and bitter. The only solace in those dark days was his wife Faldrina: a refugee of Roderic's coup. In 732, the couple bore a son named Pelagio who increasingly took over responsibilities from his father upon coming of age at 15. 

Despite hailing from a Christian family, it was thought politically expedient the boy be raised by Berber *ulama* from the newly formed Andalus. As such Pelagio grew up Muslim if only superficially. However, Faldrina held an enormous influence over her son educating him on the noble heritage passed down through her. Pelagio holds direct claim upon Hispania via his maternal uncle King Witiza. But he is also a direct descendant of both the Roman Emperors and Merovingian Franks via his great grandparents Emperor Maurice and Princess Chlodoswintha!

It is with this situation Pelagio finds himself as founder of the House of the Qutids in 769 AD. Several options are open to him. 

He could choose to abandon Islam for the faith of his father. However, that route is fraught with danger. The remaining Christian Visigothic nobility has either converted to Islam or rallied to the impoverished remains of the northern Asturian nobility. That tiny Kingdom faces almost certain annihilation and, thus, the nominal King Aurelio has more to worry about than Witiza's nephew. Likewise Francia and Lombard Italia are distracted by their own succession crises. The sons of Pepin and the elderly Desiderius will not interfere when their own realms are in danger of civil war. Of course there is Byzantium, but the current Emperor Constantine V is old and his son is preoccupied with the Iconoclast movement spreading across the Greek world. 

The new path of Islam offers little better. Abdul Rahman would certainly gladly receive Tangier's submission, but at the cost of profaning Pelagio's father's life's work. Otherwise Tangier could ally with the surrounding Berber tribes. But that too is complicated by sectarian strife. The Maghrebi Berber clans have fallen under the influence of Bedouin refugees from the Abbassid Revolution divided between the Shia, Ibadi, or Khariji sects. Pelagio could side with with one of the three, however, doing so would anger both the Umayyads in Andalus and the new Abbasid aligned governor of Ifriqiya.

p53lud,Einarr Vagnsson's Saga,"It is late summer in the year 869. In the hall of jarl Vagn of Småland, little Einarr, the son of jarl Vagn plays with some toys. Some men arrive at the hall, and Vagn offers them ale and bread. They tell the jarl that the locals speak of a troll, a hideous mythical creature, who run rampart in the surronding woods. 

Jarl Vagn consults his councilors, and desides to go out and search for the troll. He never returned. 

The men who had gone with Vagn come back and tell of what happened. Just two years after the famed year 867, jarl Vagn died, 22 winters old. 

The hall goes silent. The only sound comes from little Einarr playing with his toys. He is jarl Vagn's only son and heir. He is one winter old at the time. 

In his earliest years, Einarr made it very clear how he wanted things. His bossy behaviour lead one of his commanders to take him in and train him to lead men and win wars. 

Einarr grew up to become an ambitious man, but he was also arrogant. He was quick to anger, and many fell victim to his wrath. He also liked to write poetry, and did so from an early age. He was also bethroded to the daughter of Harald Tanglehair, Bergþóra, who was the same age as him. 

The young jarl wanted to sail out in viking, raid overseas, when he was 12 winters old. His councilers and guardian forbid him, so he let his men sail without him. A thousand men sailed from Sweden to England and the Kingdom of Wessex. The vikings sacked the church of Canterbury and went further up the Thames. While they were raiding a town, they were ambushed by anglo-saxon soldiers. The anglo-saxons were three times more and around 400 vikings met their fate at the end of the swords of Wessex. 

After the defeat in England, they sailed to the Kingdom of Lotharinga. A brief battle with the lotharingans took a heavy toll on the vikings, loosing 200 men, yet they won the battle, and managed to get some plunder with them home. Out of the 1000 that left, 400 returned, and with very little treasure to hold for it. Einarr was furious, but his men was needed in Norway and he sent them to aid Harald in his unification of Norway. 

The day of Einarr's 16th birthday was drawing near, and he was about to become a man. Some years earlier he had conquered some lands from the neighbouring Västergötland, and he was the strongest independent jarl in Sweden. He married his older sister to Sigurdr 'Snake-in-the-Eye's son, and formed an alliance with him, to secure his position as independent. Some time after his coming of age, he married Bergþóra Haraldsdottír, to further the alliance with jarl Harald. 

The young jarl found peace in his new wife and ruling of Småland for a while, but he grew restless. He gathered a force nearly twice as big as the first raiding force, and sailed to Ireland in viking. They pillaged and raped their way across Ireland, and returned home with much plunder. A year later, they went out again, this time to Francia. They made their landing in Eu, Neustria, and pillaged their way to Paris. This raiding made Einarr rich, and together with his warring in Norway, famous. But Einarr had gotten the taste of the rich and prosperous land in mainland Europe, and now he gathered men from far and wide to come with him to East Francia and settle their own land there. 

4000 men sailed with jarl Einarr Vagnsson to Ostfalen. The men of East Francia had heard about the viking raider from the north and feared his heathen army. Undisturbed, Einarr took the castles of Ostfalen. Growing tired of the endless sieges, Einar lead his men to face the defenders, and slaughtered them. The war was soon over, and on 24th of December, in the year 895, on the jólblót, Einarr declared himself the jarl of Ostfalen. 

His half sister had married the famous jarl Hæstein who had conquered a part of Iberia. Einarr aided Hæstein in defeating the various muslims and uprisings who were to come. He one time famously faced twice the amount of solidiers saying ""It's only peasants"" and emerged victorious. 

Einarr was called back to Sweden to help his brother-in-law fight against King Bjorn 'Ironside'. He helped in defeating the King's army in several battles. But suddenly, in the battle of Gävle, the famed warrior Cheiftain Ófeigr Ragnarsson managed to deal a mortal blow to Einarr.

pfm3sd,Thoughts and observations 215 hours in.,"Longer time ck2 player who got into the series around the time Old gods DLC came out. Now having put in a couple hundred on ck3 I figured i'd put down some random thoughts. 

Abducting popes and Byzantium emperors is cash money, a pope is 200 an emperor is 500 gold when you ransom them. With an intrigue focus you can abduct both at around 700 gold a cycle. 

Say you are torturing them as a pagan or anything not their religion it's an easy way to farm dread as well. 

Sometimes I amuse myself by abducting the pope, torturing him, ransoming him and then murdering him. repeat, there is no reason not to. No one has ever declared war on me for murdering popes down to the point where the pope was 23. 

I do the same to the Byzantium empire where I will abduct the emperor ransmon him for 500 and then start a murder scheme. Meanwhile using the second scheme option I'm abducting their heir to do the same thing. the heir stays in jail until the father is dead, i ransom him out and murder him in due time. 

Why the hell can I not antagonize other rulers? why can I only sway them? 
I've cucked, murdered, abducted and raped my way across europe, africa and asia and no one ever retaliates. What the hell does one need to do to piss off the AI so much they declare on me out of hate? 

Adding some sort of CB around this could be interesting. Such as you cuck a ruler and his heir is actually one of 23 children you've created, you've seduce his 16 yo daughter and gave her herpes and murdered all of his sons. Let there be some sort of revenge CB in the game, a running family feud that gets passed down generations between two dynasties.  capulet vs Montague 

armies are weird in ck3, I miss flanks and moving units to be under various commanders on the flanks due to their skills, I hope this add this in at some point. 
I do like the maps however and what they have done with the counties and the sort. 

raiding for the captives is easy money, burning across low value tribes won't give you much gold but the ransom you pick up from prisoners can be real nice when combined with pope abductions. if these prisoners are not ransomable yet of another religion murdering and torturing them is an easy way to farm some dread to keep your vassals in their place without getting any tyranny. 

The norse raiding dynasty tree is also amazing to use on this above strategy. 

The seduction tree is fun. If you happen to pick up an std, as you probably will, you can infest entire dynasties\realms with vd. king of france got you down? give his lover or wife vd and wait for him to come down with it. happen to be a gay man? seduce his son and give it to him or the pope, because why not? Overall it seems more useful to do as a focus as a female ruler. 

diplomacy and selling off hooks is money all day long, the AI cannot keep it's dick in it's pants. those hooks add up quick, great way to finance a castle upgrade.

5ljt99,AAR: Tywin Lannister Did Nothing Wrong or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Rationalize Genocide,"I've spent a long time writing this, and it probably contains some errors here and there, but I'd like to actually play the game now, so they'll have to stand. The gist should be gettable. I'm pretty sure this doesn't violate any rules, at least as far as I understand them, but if it does I'll repost elsewhere if redirected.

I've got over 500 hours in Crusader Kings 2, so it's fair to say I'm well-versed in the occasional eradication of a bloodline, from the haughty offending king all the way down to the infants in their cradles.However, I've only ever done this in the context of an overtly, almost comically, evil, bloodlusting tyrant. That changed today.  

Generally, I treat the game firstly as an RPG and secondly as a grand strategy game, so I tend to at least sort of go with the traits, heavily influenced by how I would act. 

I was playing the Game of Thrones mod. I'm several generations in, having started from the beginning of Aegon's Conquest as a custom-made Lord of Blackwater Rush. I was the very first to swear fealty to the Dragon Kings, and my family has been exceedingly loyal to them for a hundred years, literally the only family in Westeros that can claim that. The Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms has fluctuated wildly in its true number of kingdoms, from the stated seven, to nothing but the Crownlands. But always the Targaryens have stitched it back together to some degree. All told, there's probably been about a year of cumulative peace in 80 years. 

My family has served alternatingly as marshals and diplomats on the Small Council nearly the entirety of our line. I'd always trained my children with the most expensive martial education that money can buy, with highly experienced mentors to guide them, even the sole female Duchess to reign in Rayonet was ranked as one of the best generals in the land, though she was denied her rightful commission due to her sex. It was during her reign that things began to get interesting.

As I said, in her early years she was a brave and renowned general, but during her middle age the Great Plague ravaged the world for about a decade. A huge number of people died, but my court remained safe throughout by locking the castle gates and cutting access with the outside world. After years in isolation, the duchess lost her brave trait and her son, the heir, was revealed as a cruel and greedy little cretin who twice put everyone's life in danger by gorging on the meagre stockpile of rations. The second time I had to have him detained and put under house arrest for the rest of our seclusion. Even so, he was a mother's boy, and they were great friends; even with the negative modifier for locking the pudgy little ogre in a gilded cage for his formative years he had +100 relations with me. Beyond my troubles relating to my heir's gluttonous greed, I uncovered a plot where my most powerful vassal wanted to murder my husband. I tried to get him to abandon his scheme, but he'd have none of it. Fine, I guess. I'll march out into the plague ridden countryside to come drag you out of your castle myself. Things did not transpire in such a manner. Long story short, the dickbag dragon fanatics wouldn't leave their palace to come support their most loyal vassal and the traitor got the upper hand. I was dragged away to his dungeons, a cruel reversal of my plans. Now, my characters had always been master tacticians but woefully mediocre swordsmen. Nonetheless, I figured I could take on the one-handed and aging betrayer, so I demanded a trial by combat. And then the prick got one of his highly trained lackeys to hack the noble duchess to pieces after a commendably extended duel. The rule went to my now-of-age son. The son who was locked in a castle for most of his young life with no friends but his mom.

Like I said, he was a porky little jerkass who had acquired the cruel trait after his mother...sort-of-kind-of-maybe-a-little-bit beat the shit out of him with a wooden sword in his childhood in a desperate attempt to end my perpetually weak-armed rulers by training him herself. But he was also a diligent and patient man. From the day he donned the mantle of Duke he was plotting the complete destruction of House Cressey. Several years later, he raised his levies, battered down the traitor's gates, and dragged his family back to the capital to live in the finest gulag spite can provide. Like I said at the start, almost comically evil for a mildly contrived reason. 

After consideration I decided not to outright kill them all. Somewhere along the way, Duke Chubs had lost his cruel inclinations. Instead, I hopped on a boat and went as far east as east goes to whore around in the Orientos while my Count of Caloric Intake was young enough to take the ""Foreign Tour"" chain of events. Before leaving, I moved all the children to nice and comfy guarded suites. They had nothing to do with their piece of trash father's and whore mother's treasons. Those two, I left in the dungeon. I didn't move them to the deepest and darkest cells, because I didn't want to be too harsh, but I didn't really expect them to survive with the -1 health debuff, nor did I care if they didn't manage to crawl out into the cold light of day upon my return, when I planned to decide their ultimate fate if the situation called for it. The traitor's son and heir didn't end up in my custody, but his second-in-line and maleable young grandson was one of the children that lived in the locked and guarded room at the top of the tower. Noticing that the immediate heir had cancer and likely wasn't long for the world, I figured I'd raise the eventual ruler and his sister alongside my own kids Theon Greyjoy style so they'd be less inclined to cause trouble and I'd have friends for neighbors. For whatever reason it slipped my mind that Theon Greyjoy turned out to be a sniveling little jerkoff who murdered half the people he grew up with and threw a priest down a well before distracting his best friend and adoptive brother just long enough for him to get stabbed in the heart by a creepy holistic remedy enthusiast.

Moving on, I returned from impregnating the various and exotic maidens of far-flung jungles after a year to find that the husband and wife tag team duo of filth had indeed succumbed to the various ailments associated with sleeping in a dank stone room hundreds of feet below ground with only some feces-covered straw for a bed. Go figure, I guess this is what Darwin was on about. After several years of incredibly fair and non-life threatening forceful incarceration, I decided that the kids could head home, secure in my assumption that they'd behave themselves. Well, you know what they say about assuming.

That guy ruled a few more years and I decided to break from tradition and train my heir as a gentle diplomat instead of a grizzled warrior. I was unsatisfied with how his story turned out because I kind of felt like he failed to fulfill his original purpose of wholesale genocide. So, on his son's 16th birthday he knighted him and headed to the Wall, where he became First Ranger in no time at all, having just retired as the King's marshal. The new gentle and craven smooth-talking Duke assumed his role.

After a largely uneventful as far as this game is going (by which I mean only a few hundred thousand people died in the grim, dark land of Westeros, and this time I wasn't leading the charge) reign wherein I had served as the Targaryen's Master of Laws for nearly the entire duration a guy approached me asking to have some diplomatic tutoring. The event noted that it was well-known that he aspired to take my job, but a combination of doubt that he'd ever attain such levels of schmoozing brilliance as me and ever-growing apathy for serving DRAGON Kings too hesitant to use their DRAGONS to bring peace to the land led me to agree. All was well. A few years later the event triggered again with a Septon, and I noticed he was a cool dude who shared many of my traits, so I went with the option of not only tutoring, but also befriending him. Apparently doing this really, really makes the first person you agreed to help miffed. I saw that he was now my rival, and plotting to murder me. Annoyed that he was on the other side of the Riverlands and out of my ability to snatch and hang him instantly, I dug in for the long haul of a plot kidnapping. Seeing that my childhood pal of a foul-blooded traitor spawn was in on the plot, I asked him really nicely to not kill me. He agreed. Then instantly rejoined the plot. I asked him again to see if he could find it in him to not stab me. He agreed again. Then rejoined again. By this point I had had quite enough. House Cressey had blundered once too many times. I told him in my best Danny Glover voice that it, by which I meant his title, had just been revoked. The little shit decided that it hadn't and decided to fight. Alright, I'm a member of the premium rewards club over at the Iron Bank of Bravos because I'm always short on cash, so I took out a small loan of one hundred gold pieces and hired some Dornish mercs to compliment my already numerically superior forces and move to scatter the Cressey Cretins to the four winds and give the title to someone more noble, just, and sycophantic. I was just about to kick in his oft-kicked in door and drag him to my castle so that I could tell him very sternly that he either has to go scrub the floors of some palace in Volantis and forget his notions of grandeur or swallow a vial of poison. 

And then it pops up. Goons busted into my bedroom as I slept and choked me to death, telling me as I blacked out that Queen Sarya of Mountain and Vale sends her regards. I've never even heard of this broad, but she's apparently the rival of my entire family. I dunno, maybe my brother pissed her off when he and my sister decided to elope and go start a peasant rebellion around her lands or something. Now, if by some miracle you're still reading and have retained your senses, you'll recall the title of this post and my foreword. Tywin is regarded as a bad guy by a lot of people. He does commit a few straight up atrocities in his day, but he always said he did it for the good of his family. Even the rape of Tyrion's wife was ostensibly to make him realize his place in the world and learn to never tarnish the Lannister name with his naive notions of fruity concepts like love and not locking a castle's worth of people in a hole and then diverting a river into it because they defaulted on a loan. Family is all that matters to Tywin Lannister. He's a cruel man when he needs to be, but not by malicious disposition. He's driven by an intense desire to protect and strengthen his family. I said at the start that I only ever play a cruel character because I feel like it or the character has the related trait. No more. The nicest, fairest man of my dynasty was murdered for helping out a priest, and now I realize that I should employ cruelty as a means and not an end. I'm going to annihilate House Cressey and give it to someone with merits and loyalty. Then I'm going to take King's Landing the next time the realm rebels and the King cowers in the Red Keep, too afraid to use his WMDragons. And, if Queen Sarya still rules from the Eyrie when I'm done, I'll drag her kicking and screaming to the Moon Door and toss her out. But not just because I want to. Because I need to.",203,203,0,-0.2607,0.127,0.645,0.228,0.9463,0.128,0.753,0.119

**The years under the Bulgars**

*Independence and growth*

The story of Ioan begins during his times as a vassal to the Tsardom of Bulgaria, having inherited from his father the counties of the duchy of Oltenia, though not the duchy itself, and the county just west of his oltenian stronghold, being a vassal of the duke of Muntenia. Ioan was a fairly complex man, being highly zealous but also a very content man, and this would cause him at first to be a loyal vassal to his muntenian overlord, however over time relations would sour between them due to the decadence of the muntenian duke, resulting in his most important decision when he was 23 years old. He would become free of muntenian yoke and become a direct vassal of the Tsar, to become a bulwark against the north so neither barbarians nor decadence may take over the wallachian holds of the Tsardom.

This would result in his first war of independence shortly after, after all, how could he become the bulwark to protect christendom against heathens, heretics, barbarians and decadence while the vassal of a decadent ruler? The war was won surprisingly easy as although the muntenian duke had more resources in total Ioan was a far greater commander and was able to use his lesser resource much more effectively, winning the war in less than a year and distinguishing himself rapidly as an adept commander. However, shortly after the decadent Tsar Boris would throw him under the vassalage of the duke of Ohrid, who had no right to be his liege and probably only became such due to being related to Tsar Boris and begging him for someone as skilled as Ioan to be his vassal. The second war of independence would be won as well fairly easily due to his military prowess but upon returning home to Severin Ioan would find a message that made him detest the Tsar nearly to the point of rebellion, only Tsar Boris’ power and Ioan’s content nature keeping him from doing such, as he had barely come back from his campaign for independence from the duke of Ohrid that he had once more become a vassal of the very same duke, making his war meaningless.

However, on the 20th of September 887 Boris would die and would be succeeded by Tsar Vladimir “the Evil”, and with this succession the attitude of the Tsardom towards Ioan would also change drastically. On the 15th of October 888, only 11 days after it’s creation, the duchy of Cenad was handed to Ioan by Tsar Vladimir. This would begin a friendship between Tsar Vladimir and Ioan as Ioan would grow to respect the cunning and capable Vladimir even for his borderline barbarophile views and craven nature, while Vladimir would grow to hold Ioan’s military prowess in high regard as Ioan became a renowned commander of the Tsardom winning victory’s consistently for the Tsardom. This is also when Ioan’s ascension would truly begin as he would then use a claim he had fabricated to conquer the duchy of Muntenia so as to increase his military capability to better hold back the barbarian tides of the north, officially becoming duke of Muntenia on the 4th of July 889.

*The Hungarian rivalry*

For a while, his growth as duke of both Cenad and Muntenia would bring great prosperity to the realm as he would transform from a mere count into easily the strongest vassal in the realm, having over 6500 men, nearly as much as the Tsar himself, however due to his content nature and Tsar Vladimir’s kindness towards him he’d grown rather fond of the Tsar’s, finding them useful allies in his position as bulwark of the north for orthodoxy, brother of the anatolian rulers who held a title similar to his but in the east. However, his high of power would soon end as on the 13th of December 897 Arpad would conquer the majority of Pannonia with a horde so great not even the full might of Janos could stop him, especially since he had been severely weakened by another war recently reducing his army to only a 6th of it’s normal size, at 6 thousand men. Over the course of multiple wars Arpad would push further into Bulgaria’s lands within Pannonia, each time making sure to personally siege Severin, capturing the children and even wife at one point of Ioan, turning her into his concubine for the rest of her life as his army remained untouchable even by Ioan, with all of his military expertise, resulting in the deep hatred for all magyars Ioan would display later in life.

**Total defeat at the hands of the mongol hordes**

*The end of the Roman Empire and the Tsardom*

When news first appeared of the mongol horde rapidly moving towards the middle east, Ioan was happy, the muslims would likely be weakened severely whether they’d fend him off or not, and the mongol horde would likely fall upon attempting to enter the fortified themes of Anatolia, and from there the Roman Empire could extend it’s reach back across the levant and the holy land itself, possibly resulting in a full rebirth of Rome, and if that were to be the case he would be it’s most loyal servant when it came back. However, that was not to be as instead of falling at the gates of Constantinople the Mongol horde would push through the Anatolian lands like a knife through butter, punching into Anatolia in 937 and conquering the holiest, most impenetrable of cities, Constantinople, on the 15th of October 941, effectively ending the dream of the Roman Empire resurging and bringing forth the word of christ to all corners of the world as Rome was left as nothing but a rump state in Hellas. It would only be 4 years until on the 21st of September 945 that Tarnovo as well, conquering the two cities Ioan had sworn to himself he would protect with his life in the name of christianity.

*A humiliating vassalage*

Not long after the fall of Tarnovo, seeing that the Tsar can no longer protect himself, so much so his own vassals, Ioan decided to declare independence from the Tsardom as to not be caught in it’s fall as well, however as the mongols eyed him up hungrily he was forced eventually to do something that even to this day he does not wish to speak of, he was forced to become a part of the realm of the Magyars, which by this point had converted to orthodoxy, being ruled by the the Great Grandson of Arpad, Linutika II “the Tormentor”, which was a surprisingly unfit title just as Vladimir “the Evil”’s had been, though due to his direct ancestry from Arpad he was still a monster in the eyes of Ioan, one which he only joined under due to his power as Ioan saw the need to continue his realm’s survival as much as possible, lest orthodoxy die at the hands of the demonic mongols who had taken both Constantinople and Tarnovo like they were nothing.

During his time he would begin growing his power base within the Magyar Kingdom, taking back over the lands of the duchy of Cenad and through military conquest conquering the entirety of Moldavia, which would go on to be a land he would mostly to completely hold as his own to this very day, keeping the prime regions of what we nowadays know as little Romania directly under himself and united at all times.

*The mongols finally do something good*

Although the vast Mongol Empire had split into multiple states on the 1st of January 959, it’s remnants, specifically the Ilkhanate which inherited all of Persia, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Hellas, and the Golden Horde which inherited Scythia and the Kievan Rus’ lands, would remain a threat to Ioan for a long time after the death of their great khan. With that however finally the mongols under Kokochu would do something that Ioan didn’t feel completely enraged from, as on the 16th of January 879 they would conquer the majority of Pannonia, taking Cenad from Ioan again, but leaving the rest of his lands mostly unharmed, and thus he saw it as a win seeing as the magyar barbarians finally got a taste of their own rapey medicine once and for all, and simply declared independence once more, this time from the rump state of Magyaroszag.

**The slow fall of the mongols**

After getting his independence, Ioan was pleasantly surprised to see how for some reason not known even to this day both Ilkhanate and Golden Horde both seemed to have zero interest in his lands, leaving him to simply exist within his seemingly encircled pocket of christendom while they raped and pillaged wherever they could outside.

This would be a time of surprising prosperity for the kingdom of Wallachia as it’s regions would remain unmolested by foreign invaders allowing Ioan to build his strength massively. This prosperity was significantly increased as well when on the 9th of June 996 Ioan would conquer the duchy of Chersonos from Saulvedis “the Conqueror” who had conquered it 21 years earlier while the mongols were still expanding and had miraculously managed to hold onto it during that entire time. After this conquest Ioan would set up the nowadays highly renowned Merchant Republic of Chersonos with his son Valentin “the Unchaste” as first Doge of the republic, which is nowadays famed as one of the greatest merchant republics in all of history, sending merchants from from the black sea across the entire mediteranean and atlantic coast by the 13th century and across most of the world by the 16th century, being on one of the main routes of the silk road having made it titanically rich allowing for these investments across the world.

However, by this point the first of the 5 dreaded plagues would hit the world for the first time, killing thousands across the world including many of Ioan’s own family.

In the meantime, the two nearby successor states of the Mongol Empire would finally begin their slow decline as the Ilkhanate officially became an apostolic empire, laying claim to the ancient empire of Eran, also known as Persia, and viewing himself as an armenian moreso than a mongol, bringing a weird turn to the successor state during his ascension in 990. The Golden Horde on the other hand wasn’t nearly as lucky as they would find themselves rapidly destabilizing from 967 to 1013 as they would go from a Tengri Khan to a Catholic one, back to a tengri one and then finally just before the collapse of the Golden horde a Catholic one in 1013, the very same year the Golden horde ceased to be as it collapsed into many different hordes.

Sadly for Ioan and the world, the second of the five dreaded plagues would appear, this time in Iceland, and begin expanding outwards encompassing the entire world once more in sickness and death, likely adding greatly to the already highly unstable situations across the world

By 1018 things would begin to change meanwhile in the south extremely drastically as Bedugun “the Tormenter” would be installed by faction demand on the throne of Eran, transforming Eran back into a mongol Empire, but transforming it from an apostolic one into a Budhist one as Bedugun seemed to have grown inspired by the eastern peoples and adopted a militaristic version of one of their faiths and, extremely surprisingly, finally stabilizing the Empire of Eran under buddhism for the next century.

Over the next century Ioan would begin a series of wars known as the “Recuceririle” or “Reconquests”, in which he would, as the name implies, reconquer much of the land lost to the mongol horde, reconquering Constantinople by 1052 and declaring officially the Empire of Wallachia on the 1st of September 1055, with this date later being declared a national holiday known as “Ziua Renașterii Ortodoxe” or the “Day of the Rebirth of Orthodoxy”, being seen officially as the day Orthodoxy began it’s steep climb back from near death.

By the13th of August 1128, the date Eran was officially gone as a state, Ioan had conquered in the name of Christianity the entirety of Bulgaria, Georgia, Alania, Qazarstan, Scythia and most of Trebizond and the helespont itself, although by this point would would be known as the Dacispont as the entire region had officially became of romanian culture due to the kind hand of Ioan slowly converting them into romanians as the time passed, though the fact that by this point the third of the dreaded plagues had appeared in Constanta no less had likely helped to heavily depopulate the region beforehand anyways so the bringing of romanian settlers was rather helpful to it’s conversion to romanian culture. This was also around the time Konstantinoupolis was renamed to Ioanisdava after petitions from the region which declared it was time for the third chapter of the region, ending the roman chapter of Konstantinoupolis just as it had ended the hellenic chapter of Byzantion.

**Sainthood and the Eternal Empire**

By this point in time people had begun realizing that Imparat Ioan was in fact nearly 300 years old, which was rather obviously extremely above the normal age of man, however while some claimed him to be demonic in nature, others say how extremely pious he was and how he had not only set up a new Kievan Rus under the mongol Bolkhadar who he had personally converted to orthodoxy, not to mention his zealousness, virtue, and not only reconquest but personal reconversion of all of Anatolia and Pannonia and personal conversion of Scythia and the Caucasus region, easily putting him on the same level if not even high above that of a apostle, as such after much consideration Ioan was declared a living saint for his extreme virtue, zealotry and contributions to the church and orthodox people.

*The Brothers war*

Around this time on the 28th of January 1105 all the way to the 6th of July 1106 there would also be the highly renowned “Brothers War” as it was called, being a war between the brother churches of orthodoxy and catholicism over the county of Traianoupolis which a noble within the Thema of Bulgaria had used a favor on Ioan to get him to declare war over. The reason this war was such a great one was because it was against the pope who had taken Hellas for himself in a show of greed in the middle of a crusade, and at who’s defence came the entirety of Germania, Italia and Lotharingia to defend the papal holds within Traianoupolis, and many at the time had believed Ioan would finally fall to his own arrogance of believing he could defeat the catholic world. What the world did not know however was that for the last 100 years Ioan hadd only been using a mere fraction of his empire’s strength, using a combination of mercenaries, retinues and personal levies to raise an entire 21 thousand men single handedly without the sight of even a single vassal troop. Sadly for the papal forces, this 100 year period of total peace for the armies of the many themes of Wallachia would be ended that year as the full might of the Wallachia Empire was brought forth, resulting in Wallachia fighting the papal coalition with it’s full 50k strong might and winning what should’ve been a long and protracted war at best and total humiliation at worst in a single year proving the undefeatability of the Wallachian Empire under Ioan “the Living saint”.

*The wise man who was believed insane*

The next 100 years would be fairly interesting for all of Wallachia as the entirety of Anatolia would be incorporated into the Wallachian Empire with the empire now being seen as a truly legitimate one with the entire black sea as it’s De Jure lands, however surprisingly after this Ioan would bring forth an unprecedented era of peace for the next 100 years as many started believing his advanced age may have finally started catching up to him and believing him insane after he began a series of reforms that among other things reformed the entire prison system of the empire into one of reform instead of punishment and slowly but surely made women completely equal to men legally and culturally, which we now know to have been not madness, but instead merely Ioan realizing how flawed the world was and deciding to try to make the world as virtuous as he could and as much so as possible as Jesus would’ve wanted, removing violence and war and allowing his people to finally take a breath of fresh air from the constant war to prosper and live their lives. When looking back onto this period although this hasn’t been confirmed by him many believe the reason for his decision to suddenly change everything may have also been heavily influenced by the death of his great great great great granddaughter Petra and her daughter Stana to the third wave of the dreaded plague. 

It is believed these along with many other deaths to the dreaded plagues were the reason he began what is nowadays known as “The Medical Revolution”, investing in a genuine wall of hospitals around the entirety of little Romania  and hospitals all across it as well, though the project would be too early to stop the 4th of the dreaded plagues from penetrating little Romania for the first time in history during the 5th dreaded plague a region of the world was finally completely free of plague for the entire duration of the plague, that region having been Oltenia, the deepest imperial heartland of the Wallachian Empire which was second only to Ioanisdava in how wealthy it was at the time, though with time would grow to outshine even the eternal city of Ioanisdava as Severin would become the new eternal city of the world.",10,10,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.9964,0.11,0.803,0.087

8uu4kw,How I created Israel,"boring ass story with TLDR at bottom. Might be a common strategy but I haven't seen anyone do it like this

So I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible CK2 player. I have 300 hours on it, but I still can hardly handle newbie Ireland. But I was set on getting the Kingdom of David achievement.

And so, I went and played the one jewish character in the world, the Gideon Dynasty in the Duchy of Semien in 769. And maybe it's easy, but I found it really hard since Jewish MA is almost rock bottom. your counties will remain Miaphysite and revolts WILL occur. And your neighbors are soon to be Abyssinia and Egypt. And even if you don't get raped by those, you have the sunni Caliph to worry about. 

And so I tried. And I had one strategy where I would expand as quickly as I could before Abyssinia is actually created and united, but your only CB is holy war, so you're taking on all of Abyssinia anyway. 

That didn't go very well, so instead I tried making the duchy of Semien a fortress. Farm technology, build castles and cities and upgrade them. So while it takes time, you are one badass mothafucka. 

But after 250 years of complete fucking boredom I realized technology and upgrades aren't worth fucking shit. So I gave up on that idea.

And then it hit me; ""Wait, if the Caliph controls the entire area needed to create Israel why don't I just play as the Caliph and convert to Judaism?""

This is obviously easier said than done. But since the Sunni Caliphate title can be destroyed with no opinion malus I just did it. It's 769 so I don't need to worry about Crusades, and with the tributaries you spawn with a fuckton of gold, so if your ungrateful vassals decide to revolt because they're antisemitic dickheads you can hire mercenaries. 

So I holy warred down to Semien and just took it. Killing Jews is fun. And then I revoked the county of Semien so that it's my demesne county, and I could convert to Judaism.  

Obviously my vassals start to hate me, but fortunately my vassals are greedy little bitches so I can satisfy them with gifts. 

Jewish MA is 17% at this point, so my court Rabbi had a 0.69% chance to convert Jerusalem. Oh well, one can only wait. But then, he showed up. A jew with 21 learning. It took him barely a week to convert a key vassal. And then within just a few years he had converted so many vassals that the holy sites were in Jewish control ^(and my vassals think im pretty cool now)

MA spiked to 70. Conversion rate for Jerusalem went from 0.69% to 7.6. After that, all I had to do was wait. And as if on queue, I died and my heir was sinful as fuck, so yeah, took a while to get that piety. Thank god for passover. 

TL:DR I created Jerusalem as the Sunni Caliph.

However, my happiness quickly turned to ashes as soon as we consummated our marriage. Or failed doing so I guess, since I just realized that if she is celibate, I assume she must have resisted most vehemently against all my advances. Now this must be the reason to the strange willingness of that SoB of an emperor to dispose his sister so under her status.

3tr91i,[ACCIDENTALLY TURNED RANT HALFWAY THROUGH] My only wish for this game: replace Hungarian cultural units with something else,"Nationalist rant, because why the heck not.

**EDIT**: Turned more rantish-ramblingish than I was expecting it to be. Welp. Enjoy your pseudo-historial lesson.

&nbsp;

So, basically, let's ignore the fact that Hussars first appear about 4 years before the game ends and the actual light cavalry that existed alongside the Black Army of Mathias Corvinus that we nowadays call ""Hussars"" are only finally called thataway in 1481. Depending on the DLCs you've got, that's only, like, 400-700 years off. Though it makes me wonder what cultural unit we got in EU4. Never played that game.

&nbsp;

But the Poles, Pomerania and Bohemia (these latter two had Hussars??) also get these retinues, if I recall correctly. Why. I dunno about the latter two, but Polish Hussars first appear in the 1500s or so, and they're literally only Hussars in name.

&nbsp;

Y'see, the word ""Huszár"" has ""husz"" in it. That's because for every 20 lot (""húsz"" = 20 in Hungarian), you had to have a peasant to sign up for the light cavalry. You ain't gonna waste shit on peasants! Slap 'em with a horse and tell 'em to run around in circles heckling the opposition. So, they were light cavalry.

&nbsp;

Polish Hussars were also more heavily armoured shock cavalry, and were mostly made up by nobles. Also, the most iconic military unit of the Kingdom of Poland was a Hungarian one that exists for four years. Jolly good show.

&nbsp;

No wonder the AI can't perform a simple Honfoglalás. It's asking its vassals for shit that doesn't even exist yet:

&nbsp;

""Alright, Marshall, prepare the men. Call forth the light cavalry. For every twentieth lot you see, bring a peasant to battle.""

""Very well, my gyula, but what's a lot? And, uh, 'Marshall'?""

""SUCH INSOLENCE! YOU WILL NOW ADRESS ME AS KHAN!""

""Kh- I mean, uh, okay, I guess? But seriously, why? And anyways, where is the kende-""

""I RULE IN THE TRIBE OF MAGYARS, ALONE!""

""'Tribe'? But we literally named this shit 'Sevenmagyars', because, y'know, seven tribes-""

""I'M SICK OF YOUR BULLSHIT, YOU'RE GOING TO THE OUBLIETTE""

""The what now- HELP, ÁLMOS'S GONE ABSOLUTELY BONKERS!""

&nbsp;

^((Yes, yes, it is not known what type of high prince Álmos was, kende [sacred ruler] or gyula [military leader], but from a gameplay perspective, we're most likely a gyula as Álmos. Plus going from the fact that the game doesn't allow theocracies or dual monarchies, and that ""Kündür"" [Khazar version, most likely the inspiration for the kende title] is a minor title [...for every Tengri ruler...], we're definitely playing as a gyula.)^)

&nbsp;

Anyway, my suggestion-slash-wish is that the Hungarian retinue be replaced with horse archer based one. Why? Because the fact that we also did the horseback feigned retreating thingy that the Huns a few hundred years before us was basically the reason we were mistaken for the Huns and are still called Hungarians.

Alternatively, make the even troops these type of horse archers, but give no cultural retinue for the Hungarians. There are no famous ""special troops"" for Hungarians during this time period that I could name at the top of my head, and we could live the surprise mass arrow-rape tactics for the Altaic culture.

&nbsp;

Am I done? I think I am. Welp, off to sleep.

#2. Same campaign, similar situation.  I'm fighting in Aquitania, and I capture the queen consort who also has a claim to Italy. Concubinage ensues, I convert her to Zoroastrianism, conquer Italy for her and mere month before she died, she gives me an heir.

#3. Pictish campaign. I'm having a claim on Italy, which just got conquered by a host.

tl;dr at bottom

So I have been able to take the kingdom of abyssnia, and the kingdom to the north, had to load back to an earlier save because.. well you can guess what happened.

Dealing with moral authority struggle? juggling revolts because unable to convert counties. Only 1 holy site is feasible to grab seeing as its not apart of the blob (yet).

How to handle the rape train that is sunni? Leader of abbisad has around 30-40k troops to swing around, I know your supposed to handle a stack at a time, I can handle an 8-9k stack but not back to back to back to back. No real mercenaries to speak of down in east africa, 2 2500 troops for 225 each 10per month econ cant support that.

Isnt the empire supposed to be unstable? checked the opinion of his vassals and all but 3 (yes three) have less than 50 towards him. That said there is little to no chance for me to push his vassals into a revolt.

How do I convert into the other jewish culture? non etheopian, The one that the mysterious wandering jews have.

**September 26, 1246:** 

[My name is King Oswulf I of Syria](http://i.imgur.com/QLcEY99.jpg). I am not a good man. I have killed my own; tortured those who deserve no torture, and let good men die in my place. Due to my Nephew’s incredible ineptness I have inherited a mere sliver of what my family once owned. Due to his incompetence [I did what I had to do… ](http://i.imgur.com/8qzsVPj.jpg). I am 48, and surrounded by vast empires and living on borrowed time… I do not have long in this world.

[**October 2, 1246:**](http://i.imgur.com/yRZOXFH.jpg)

I have no need for a vassal… I moved my armies south and sent riders ahead to let the Count of Al Jazira know that his services are no longer needed. 

[**October 5, 1246:**](http://i.imgur.com/X54Z2gX.jpg) 

Duchess Judit II of Tabriz wishes for me to assist her in her conflict, I cannot believe her nerve. How dare she ask for help from me, when mere years earlier she was leading a rebellion against my cousin and dividing my inheritance! She shall receive no help from me!

Huge armies mass to the north and the south of me. Their forces outnumber mine 15-1. I have no allies… My family is divided and will not come to my aid and [I cannot afford mercenaries…](http://i.imgur.com/SPh3GEL.jpg). I will fight. I may be a fat pig… but I will not be the last of family to rule these lands.

**Aug 28, 1247:** 

The war goes badly… I write as we march to meet the enemy in battle. I… I do not know what I have done. I am a cruel man. My wife… I love her… but my son… my heir… he is unlanded and I, I am about to lose everything my family has fought for. My wife… She is duchess of Poland… [with her death](http://i.imgur.com/WyEhIga.jpg) my son is now a Duke of Poland… he is safe. He is far from this hell-damned land. Maybe one day he will lead an army back to this place and reclaim our kingdom. 

**Aug 30, 1247:** 

They call me “The Kinslayer,” but they do not understand why I have done what I have. I will be known as Oswulf the damned or the useless, but I have only done what I have for my family… my blood.

[**September 13, 1247:**](http://i.imgur.com/tqXQOnm.jpg) 

My people, my Kingdom, if I can even call it that, will all be lost if I do nothing, but even I fight there is no chance for victory. I have decided to lead my men into battle. I may be scholar and poet, I may be unfit and untrained in war, but I will fight with my men and hopefully, hopefully, die with them as Syrians. 

**October 14-22, 1247:** 

The battle from the moment it began was a rout. Baron Ademar was killed in the first day of fighting and the right flank collapsed almost immediately afterwards. [On October 21 the Pope sent ambassadors with chests full of gold to help with the war effort](http://i.imgur.com/rwJpV1B.jpg). A mere day later [the battle was done.](http://i.imgur.com/NQip4ij.jpg) My men were almost all dead or if not that, wounded. My horse was slain in combat as well as almost all of my honor guard.

He calls me a craven, and threatens to tell everyone what really happened during the Syrian-Mongol War. [50 gold!](http://i.imgur.com/FGAoxGU.jpg) I do not have 50 gold, but I couldn’t let my vassals and servants know of my cowardice during the war… I… I had to pay. This whole debacle has angered me so greatly that after dinner [I think I’m going to pay my prisoner a very long visit…](http://i.imgur.com/WVE1kMU.jpg).

**November 12, 1251:** 

My allies will not join me, I cannot afford any mercenaries, and my army is too small to successfully lay siege to my enemy’s holdings… All the money I do make is immediately spent on supplying my army with food and supplies… It has become a waiting game with no clear ending in sight.

**April 29, 1255:** 

The war continues. No new ground has been covered in the last 3 and half years. My vassals openly mock me and the servants are always whispering secrets when they walk by me. I have become so bored lately that not even my books amuse me anymore… Thank God for the dungeons and its never ending supply of… entertainment.

[My steward has been openly stealing from my coffers for the past 10 years!](http://i.imgur.com/zA6nuCl.jpg). All I wanted to do was to kill him, hang him from the roof, and skin him like a beast. My council advised a different route though… My council advised me to force my former steward to repay all the money he has taken. At first I was hesitant, but with this money I could end my war with the Count of Bira once and for all. 

[**July 29, 1257:**](http://i.imgur.com/d7Ojz4A.jpg)

I conquer the three holy sites of Scandinavia so I can reform the faith. As I am about to do this I conquer Venice with my viking hordes as they heard of the wealth of the province. abandoning the usual rape and pillage they decide to settle so they can use it as a new base of operations to raid the wealthy Mediterranean.

The new vikings in venice take on the government type of the previous doges to keep the populace tame and less likely to rebel.


Now I make sure I have family members in control of the Scandinavian holdings and give the respective powerful branches of my line the king titles of Norway and Sweden while keeping the title of Venice. I have now consolidated my power in Venice and gotten the Scandinavian holdings into separate branches of my family so now I am just the sole island of Venice raiding the Mediterranean and planning on staying and conquering myself island empire of the Mediterranean.

*The Diary of King Belasko II as written by /u/Kamikyu*

**1016, 6, 6 - The coronation.** 

[Diganty. Honor. Fatherhood. That was all that life meant to me. Then my own father died. And next thing I knew, I was king.] (http://i.imgur.com/JbVheMf.png)    
I kneeled on a marble platform in Beni Yani, or New Zeruko. [The town was small for being a capital.] (http://i.imgur.com/8YzWox6.jpg) Probably why I liked it. Drops of sweat bathed me as the metal circlet was placed on my head. It was cold. Not warm like I always imagined.    
There was no speech.    
There was no great cheer.    
There was only silence. As a Basque culture, the descendants of my Great Grandmothers rag-tag band of refugees were serious as always. I sent out two carrier pigeons, across the great waters. One was for the body of my father to be shipped here, for a formal funeral. My father, Belasko the first had always suffered with what his doctors called “Pulmonary” disorders. I could only assume that one of them was what killed him.

Second of all I ordered the troops to continue the war. War was a bloody thing. I hate pbloody things. But it was a necessity, at times. But what do I know of necessity? I am but a simple ruler - cursed by having to rule. This crown is far too tight on my head. I hope that what comes next will be...easy. But Allah knows I am delusional to think that I am to have no challenges.

***

**The rest of 1016, the year of war.**


 If you bother to read my Journal, my children, excuse the previous page which I have scribbled out. The first year of my reign was not only stressful, but bloody. First order of business - end my Father’s war.

***

**Spring and Summer** 

Why he started it, I am not sure. Does it matter? Men have died, and more men will die. [My job is to make sure it is more of them that die, not us.] (http://i.imgur.com/IZhKMUN.png) A simple task may it be. The siege shall continue.
Emotions are dulled by distance. Across the Sea, I can not help but wonder how my ancestors felt as they ordered men to die in Iberia. At least my father fought in battle. I would do the same, but, I have business to attend to. I must listen to the bewailing widows, and the sychophants DAY in and DAY OUT. It is fustrating. I play  jeu de paume  with my sisters to relax. And meanwhile men die.

I take strolls from time to time, in the hilly city streets. A coin for a beggar, or a visit to a local merchant. Anything to ease the pain of my people. It is what Allah wills, and what my legendary ancestor, Anderkina would of done. My cultural cousins of Andalusia must wonder what strange custom it is to live across the sea. Owning half of Cantabaria, my subjects seem torn in culture.

Bah. Culture. I live as a human - as all men do. Islam, Catholocism, Orthadoxy, The Cathar, The Yazidi who worship Shaytan. All men exist equally.    

But more often than not, all men die equally.

***

**Fall and Winter**

The year progresses. Fighting is light, but intense. Acute strikes against  scattered armies happens often, as we beat down the enemy. [But best of all, they fight amongst one another.] (http://i.imgur.com/Y0SqUNT.png) Good, I say! It saves my men lives. Or so it did. I cry for my people day in, and day out. Why must we suffer on this earth? But take heart, the way is almost won. We are soon to be the owners of Barcelona.

Or so I thought when I wrote this. Travesty and tragesty! Allah threw away our lives for nothing! At least now the widows menfolk sleep in Paradise! Law!? You call this LAW!? I dressed in rags and went to the highest tower of the castle to commune with the Greatest. The war is over do to some technicality. Lives thrown away! Lives lost! [And all we got out of it was the satisfaction of burning down five cities, and capturing the wife of ONE general.] (http://i.imgur.com/CFYtgmf.png) 
What sin did we do? What travesty have we committed? Why did I inherit this kingdom!? To rule our men, JUST to lose hundreds of lives, and then it all be for NOTHING do to some LEGAL transaction!? My children WILL rule a brighter country, I swear on the Qu’ran, I swear on the Prophets, I swear TO ALLAH. [And to do this? We need allies.] (http://i.imgur.com/WStUPat.png)
My oldest daughter is a brat, but oh my soul, I love her. I intended to marry her off to a descendant of Muhammad, PBUH, and the heir to a great Sultanate. [He, or atleast his guardian, accepted without question.] (http://i.imgur.com/WStUPat.png) This sacred bethrothal means only one thing - Allah favors us to have a strong alliance.

Allah favours us, and now I shall show to Allah, that we favor him. Ramadan! My belly weakened, and my bowels ceased to function, but by God, I proved to the Greatest, that he is MY Greatest. [Now, for the feast! This is a break, and a celebration.] (http://i.imgur.com/fmqDKXw.png)

***


**1017, 1, 28, - For my children, I do many things.**

This entry follows Ramadan, and is written by a troubled man. I am that man. Did I really, just sell out my oldest child for extra soldiers in war? Is that what I really did? Did Allah even speak to me? I have thought on this for hours, locked away in my room. Non-Al-Andalus Europa is a challenge to my very existence. Italy, Francia, and Provence all stick out as threats to me, and my children. For my children, I must secure a European holding out side of Al-Andalus. [I have chose Aquitaine, our old Allies, who back stabbed us and broke their alliance with us when we  became muslim.] (http://i.imgur.com/D0hgfel.png) 
This time, I will fight myself. I will kill. I will spill blood. I am a good father, and not only will my heir be healthy physically, but spiritually healthy, and honored and revered by all men. So I declared Jihad. Jihad for the Aquitanian-Toulouse duchies. This will give us power in the Trade Leagues, and a foot hold on Europe. As my Great, Great, Grandmother, Elida said, “Deus Vult!” I can not help but oblige the favor on our northern neighbors, who oppress my childrens legacy.

***

**1017’s Spring - War and Reality.**

 I fought in my father’s wars more than once, and still, today, I say, armor fits me much better than a crown! Gold and tan laced over with a robe, also gold and tan, I looked like a desert lion, riding proudly on my Horse. The horses that Elida brought with her had been bred thoroughly. And speaking of breeding, Allah pardon my uncouth manner,  my wives all bid me farewell. As I sail across the sea, I ponder upon my wives, who in the past I looked at as children and alliance makers. Maryam is my love, I do believe. She did not kiss me raunchily, or offer to come to my bed chamber before I left for Andalus. She embraced me tenderly, and whispered comforting words in my ear, and how Allah loved me. She is my [love] (http://i.imgur.com/TfPChj0.png) when my world is full of hatred. 

Six Thousand strong we were before tragedy and treachery befell us! The pass between Aquitaine and Navarre is where we planned to meet in battle, before one by one destroying the honorless basque french. Then they came. They came to sow discord, rape our women, and loot our banking system. The NORSE DOGS fell upon us. A rebel from the noble house of Yngling who was our physical rival in the Ire-land,  had come raiding us, wanting blood and gold. Cutting off a thousand of our men, and killing them [in just a few months times.] (http://i.imgur.com/Xga6WNo.png) The Aquitainian Basque approach us, no more then a hundred in number greater than us. We were shattered by this small difference and sent running for the coast of Barcelona. 

Vindication is mine, no Angel or Man would oppose my righteous indignation. [Those who are responsible, would reap.]  (http://i.imgur.com/kqBHAIo.png) And now what he had [sown] (http://i.imgur.com/ynmsTq9.png) was [fruitful] (http://i.imgur.com/J2giXIH.png) ...For us.

While we regrouped from Barcelona, sadly, more men fell into the remaining Norsemen’s [trap] (http://i.imgur.com/clMi4aX.png) .

I myself, was forced to go back to North Africa, for the sake of [crushing an aquitanian noble who had a holding in my capital.] (http://i.imgur.com/gPVbTk2.png) No doubt this was not Luck, but Allah’s working, to bring my back to Africa. We had many troops to resupply us that day.

***

**1017, through the end of the year.**

 What type of inoiz [[A word with many meanings, but one of which is “Shitty.”]] [war IS this, exactly?] (http://i.imgur.com/oQNILIF.png) I toil for MONTHS to invade my OWN capital, as men around me die every day. EVERY day. Meanwhile, thanks to the norse animals, our main force must guard a pass, instead of invading. Even while I write this, arrows bombarded the siege camp. [I called this war in the name of Allah, and now others come in the name of the Christian version of the Greatest. And now I suffer for the Greatest.] (http://i.imgur.com/n3JMnrp.png) Wessex has attacked our seige camp. They snuck up behind us in the night, and went tent to tent, killing us. Luckily, one of the men was committing sodomy with another man, funny how the Greatest works, and was awake when they came to his camp. Screaming, the entire camp was awoke in minutes. Organizing a defence line, we quickly rallied the main force, and retreated, but not with losing so many good men. It got worse. Our [Irish] (http://i.imgur.com/OrX7ew1.png) nieghbors came to kill even more good men. [The norse have been driven off, valiantly however.] (http://i.imgur.com/USUALU1.png)

So much war…..for the sake of my children. Am I delusional to think that this helps them!? Even my young son mocks me. 
This war has brought much misery. What could go worse?

**The diary of King Henry 'the Vainglorious' d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/NoroSteve*



**4th December 1168**



 



I am [king](http://i.imgur.com/pqZuMPi.jpg) Henry of Syria, my Reign begins now.  Although my house has risen to bask in a vast amount of glory, I will rise up to become the greatest ruler of all time.  As I am writing, I can already see the kingdom that I am going to carve out appear before my eyes.  This is my time, my rule, and I demand greatness.



 



In order to prepare for the wars that I will ultimately wage at some point, I have spend a vast amount of [gold](http://i.imgur.com/rvZBSNK.jpg) on the retinues that I have employed.  My Marshall tells me that we can now afford to hire 4500 men, I have ordered him to immediately get to work hiring these soldiers, my vast kingdom isn't going to create itself.



 



**21st January 1169**



 



My son Henry emerged from the dungeon with a bloody knife today.  Upon investigation, it appears that my son had managed to carve the skin off of one of the chained up prisoners arm.  He was lucky he wasn't hurt.  What surprised me even more is that, upon taking to him about what he had done, I got the feeling that he seemed to enjoy causing that man pain.  I fear henry will continue down this [cruel](http://i.imgur.com/RY9Hh70.jpg) path.



 



**10th March 1169**



 



I was informed today that there is a [band of robbers](http://i.imgur.com/kG6Shf7.jpg) roaming the countryside in Tell Bashir.  The peasants are running scared.  These fools!  I will cut off all of their heads!  If only they realised what they have started; I have ordered a man hunt for these thieves, and I will make to sure to make an example of these fools.  No one steals from my people and gets away with it!



 



**7th April 1169**



 



My wife sat me down today to inform me of her [pregnancy!](http://i.imgur.com/L8TaM3C.jpg)  Glorious news!  I am hoping for a son, so that I can train him in the art of warfare.  I can already see the man that he will become, a vicious knight who rules with an iron fist!



 



**15th April 1169**



 



The sultanate of Egypt is in turmoil, civil wars plague the land.  I have taken this opportunity to [declare war](http://i.imgur.com/eXGRStN.jpg) on one of rebelling vassals.  This is the start of my kingdom, first I take Jerusalem, and then the rest of Egypt’s unholy leaders will fall under my might!



 



**10th May 1169**



 



Although it has taken me some time to sent the letters, I have received word that the full might of my army is riding towards the capital.  We shall amass as one unbeatable force, and the storm frail city of Jerusalem.  My glory is coming, I can see it, my name shall live forever, King Henry 'The Great' of Syria they shall call me before long!



 



**14th May 1169**



 



My chancellor, along with my Marshall arrived in my chambers today.  They seemed surprised that I was not dressed, and simply lying in bed, bah, I am the king, if I want to lye in bed all day then that is exactly what I will do!  Upon getting dressed, I was informed that my war can no longer be carried out, due to a [liege change](http://i.imgur.com/gAEUcpp.jpg) on Jerusalem!  How could this have happened, the civil war was over so quick!  I simply cannot wait for another civil war to break out to seize my opportunity for greatness!



 



There shall be other wars I suppose, at least I can relax and enjoy life for the next couple of weeks.



 



**27th May 1169**



 



A glorious thing has occurred!  The pope must have heard about my lost cause of a war!  He has called a [crusade for Jerusalem!](http://i.imgur.com/DbWVGhK.jpg)  This is my chance, why take a small part of Jerusalem, when I can have the entire kingdom!  This is it, my kingdom of Syria is finally happening, in a few years time I shall have the mightiest kingdom the world has ever seen!



 



**30th August 1169**

 



Just as my troops were amassing near my capital, I was handed a letter, straight from my good friend the emperor!  He wants me to join in on a [holy war](http://i.imgur.com/Z4qayHd.jpg), fine, I will send him a letter informing him of acceptance of this offer; I shall not however, be giving him any troops.  They are already moving one direction, why on earth would I move them in another, that’s a lot more walking than I think I want to do!



 



**6th November 1169**



 



Just as my troops finished amassing outside of the capital, I have been informed that my wife has given birth in another part of the castle!  [I have a daughter!](http://i.imgur.com/528LHyV.jpg)  I can already imagine all of the great things that this baby girl will achieve in her long and healthy life!  She will marry a great ruler, and we shall carve out an empire!  Such as great day!



 



**2nd January 1170**



 



It pained me to leave my home, my wife, my children, but the war demands it, it would not be right to join a crusade and not march into battle.  We have been [marching](http://i.imgur.com/tGhSu4P.jpg) for a long time, so long that I have grown incredibly tired from walking.  I will no longer be marching with my men, to hell with the morale, the king is tired, and the king does what he wants!  I will ride a horse from now on.  One of the side flank leaders told me that my men are starving, but what do I care?  We will still arrive in Jerusalem with an unbeatable force!  If the men starve, then they deserve death for being so useless!



 



**28th January 1170**



 



We have arrived in battle!  A fierce fight has broken out!  I am cutting down men left and right!  Although their faces look grim as I cut them down, they should rest easy that they have had the pleasure to die by the hands of a Christian!  Although I care little for religion, I am still catholic, and these infidels should fear my might!



One of the infidels managed to [hit me](http://i.imgur.com/PH3qFlN.jpg) with a warhammer, such a barbaric weapon!  Although I have been telling my men that the blow I have received is only minor, I can fell the breath leave me every time I swing at a man, I fear that I been wounded!



 



**3rd February 1170**



 



6 days of fighting, and it is finally over.  My Marshall tells me that we have suffered incredibly minor losses, not even losing a tenth of our men, glorious!  We were joined by the king of England during the middle of the battle, it was glorious, a [battle to remember!](http://i.imgur.com/tm4PXUh.jpg)



 



**5th April 1170**



 



I have received word that the [betrothal](http://i.imgur.com/T5SR5Ov.jpg) has been finalised.  My son will marry the daughter of the kingdom of Sicily.  This alliance will merge our two great houses, and allow the both of us to carve out a magnificent kingdom!



 



I have also given the order for my men to [move to another province](http://i.imgur.com/hg3ayty.jpg), having two armies stationed here at the same time is proving unwise, 3 thousand of my men have starved while we sit here and hope that we can breach the walls!  3 thousand men dead for nothing!  How am I supposed to carve out a magnificent kingdom with 3 thousand rotting corpses?  Such a waste!



 



**15th June 1170**



 



As we are moving to the Provence of Acre, I spotted what appeared to be a 600 man army amassing outside of the city walls.  I ordered my men to surround the army.  14 thousand men surrounding 600.  There were no talks of peace.  This was a message to all those who oppose me.  [It was a slaughter](http://i.imgur.com/yY5iQuy.jpg), and I hope there are many more before this crusader is over.



 



**13th August 1170**



 


The wound that I suffered all that time ago has finally healed, leaving a [pretty nasty scar](http://i.imgur.com/s2MB2Xe.jpg).  I remember the man who gave me this wound in the first place.  I remember his face when he realised that he has left his side open in the process, I remember sticking my sword straight into his pathetic body.  Warhammers are viscous weapons, when you know how to use them.



 



**15th September 1170**



 



I fell as though my army has been outside of Acre for decades.  We have achieved little, caused a disturbance here and there, cutting off food supplies, but we do not seem to be making a dent in the walls.  I received word that the soldiers of Acre are [starving](http://i.imgur.com/vtRda5s.jpg) due to the lack of food.  Good.  The sooner they all starve to death, the sooner we can get to the killing, sacking and burning of this pathetic excuse for a city.



 



I have also sent word to the capital to inform them that I seek to enforce [Larger feudal taxes](http://i.imgur.com/ThgutfQ.jpg) than those that are currently in place.  How am I supposed to keep an army going without money?  This is a sacrifice that the realm with have to deal with, glory is all I case about.



 



**22nd September 1170**



 



Anger such as this is something that I have not felt in an incredibly long time.  I felt as though my blood was leaking from my veins as I read the letter that was handed to me.  “It is time for you to recognise the full [independence](http://i.imgur.com/oYZ44GA.jpg) of Aleppo and the other states in the independence faction.  Be reasonable and let us not resort to bloodshed”.  I am the king of Syria, and if this traitorous filth wants independence, then they are going to have to fight I, the great king Henry, as well as my allies.  This will end in bloodshed, you can be assured of that, I am your King!  You owe me allegiance!  You will suffer greatly for this, pain you could not possibly comprehend is coming your way!



 



**13th October 1170**



 



My troops are occupied in the crusade, they will not be moving from this city, until my men have shed copious amounts of blood from this filthy place.  The emperor has agreed to [join my war](http://i.imgur.com/GEi0hUn.jpg), this wretched woman cannot hope to fight both me, and the Byzantine Emperor at the same time can she?  What a fool!  I need not waste a single man on this pathetic rebellion.



 



**24th February 1171**



 



I grow tired with this siege, I lost perhaps 4 thousand men while assaulting this pathetic city, I grew tired of the siege, but my god did the men make up for the dead, they must have raped, killed and burned their way through the entire length of the city!



 



Although the sack of the city was a great one, I have received a letter.  The last letter I received announced a rebellion, so I can only hope that this one will announce the end of the rebellion, or something along the lines of good news.



[Another rebellion](http://i.imgur.com/8GRTGLM.jpg).  Duke Wymund seeks to claim the kingdom of Mesopotamia.  I completely forgot about that title, but I suppose it holds some sort of value to this pathetic man.  Fine, if he wishes to go to war, then so be it.  When I win, he shall be blinded, tortured, killed.  Then, I will gather up his children, and do the same to them, his friends will meet the same fate, his wife, anyone he has ever loved with suffer my wroth! 



 



**23rd March 1171**



 



My son Henry grows [ambitious](http://i.imgur.com/Oa6uWUb.jpg).  Good, at least someone has the sense to want greatness.  It has also come to my attention that Duke Wymund has called Duke Serlo of Tigris into this pathetic war.  I cannot deal with this!  I have such a lack of men, only 4 thousand remain after this crusade!  How on earth am I supposed to fight off two rebellions at once?!  I can already feel my heart beating faster than I know it should.  We march for Syria.  Hopefully I can end this rebellion and kill this traitor before he manages to damage the kingdom any further.  I will have to carve out the greatest kingdom the world has ever seen another day.



 



**11 September 1171**



 



I have arrived in the lands of the [great independence faction](http://i.imgur.com/cMR5JBd.jpg).  I can already see that they posed a tremendous threat to the great kingdom of Syria.  What a pointless war, lost before it begun I think.  The countess will be tortured, passed around between the men, and suffer a humiliating death.  A shame, this need to happen if she simply accepted my rule and continued on with her pathetic life.



 



**11th December 1171**



 



The countess [surrenders](http://i.imgur.com/k6LwKQL.jpg), the duchy of Allepo will once again become part of the kingdom of Syria, and the troops will be joined to mine.  Just in time as well, as I see the other rebellious men marching towards me.  They will die, they do not realise it yet, but they are walking into a slaughter.  One rebellion down, one to go.



 



**30th December 1171**



 



As the rebellious army marches towards the capital, my men, as well as my the new additions to my army, [amass outside of the capital](http://i.imgur.com/RIXtxoW.jpg).  This coming battle will decide the fate of the realm.  While they starve on their march, I will be hiring men to join the retinue of my soldiers.  This is a battle already victorious.



 



**18th February 1171**



 



I have received word that the [band of robbers](http://i.imgur.com/A873X69.jpg) that were plaguing the lands of Tell Bashir have been rounded up.  Brought before me, they suffered miserable deaths, and their heads and sitting nicely on a spike, as a message to all those who oppose me.



 



**4th March 1172**



 



I had not seen my wife in years since I joined the crusade.  Although it pains me to leave her once more, I must.  I was surprised at how big my new daughter had grown.  I will get to know her better when I return from battle.  The rebellious army have starved to the point where they have decided to besiege some city which holds little to no value in the kingdom of Syria.  My army has amassed, and we ride to battle, victory awaits us, [victory awaits my men!](http://i.imgur.com/JnKd44G.jpg)



 



**1st May 1172**



 



[We are victorious!](http://i.imgur.com/QqzEQGq.jpg)  A horrific battle, it was glorious.  We lost almost 3000 men, while they lost 4000.  At this point, we have the advantage, how long do they think that can keep on?  They have lost half of their army!  This is truly a pathetic rebellion, one which I will crush with the mighty weight of my boot.

**The diary of King Belasko**, *as written by /u/phargmin*

[25 September, 997](http://i.imgur.com/nR5CNZQ.jpg)

My father, Beltran, has been taken to Allah.  At his bedside, with his dying breath, he urged me to strike down our enemies and bring glory back to House Neffarako.  An old man, he himself had lacked only the time to expand our lands.  A man in middle age myself, I know that my time on our ancestral throne will not be long.

Today at my coronation I, [Belasko](http://i.imgur.com/5dIg5Hp.jpg), the first of my name, King of Navare and Scourge of Iberia promised to pick up the sword immediately, and reign fire down upon our enemies, in whatever way possible.

My [first](http://i.imgur.com/gEJHXnd.jpg) mission was to secure an alliance with our neighbors of the faith in Iberia.  I have been blessed with many sisters and daughters, enough to weave a web of alliances large enough to protect us.  The Sultan is not interested in taking another wife, but if one of his were to fall to a tragic accident...

[15 February, 999](http://i.imgur.com/rg1TXPA.jpg)

Though I had promised to strike quickly, I have found that time flies when dealing with the various affairs of court.  Eventually, I had to stop my councilors and declare that today we will wage war!  I am yet untested in battle, and so expanding into Sardinia may be an excellent stepping-stone to glory.

[5 August, 1000](http://i.imgur.com/iLYyWPE.jpg)

Our chance has come.  While campaigning in Sardinia I was sent a letter by raven informing me that the Duke of Barcelona had stricken his banners and declared himself separate from West Francia.  This was it.  No stepping-stone.  An enemy as great as ourselves.  One outcome glory, the other utter defeat.

[26 February, 1002](http://i.imgur.com/QjvLSHK.jpg)

After 2 years of campaigning, here I stand atop Barcelona's highest hill, the city sacked beneath me.  The Duke has been captured and with a single swing of my sword his head rolled down the steps of the city's grandest cathedral.  I declared this land part of Navare, and have appointed one of my most trusted and skilled men to govern the city and surrounding provinces in my name.  Today I have brought glory to House Neffarako.  No longer will the peoples of Europe think of us as irrelevant.  They will rue the day they threw my people out of our homeland.

[12 January, 1005](http://i.imgur.com/w4Crate.jpg)

I have continued to expand across Iberia.  Every chance I get, I strike out against the surrounding peoples. The smaller ones have been conquered, and now only the larger states remain.

[6 January, 1006](http://i.imgur.com/FcYEqyI.jpg)

I have not slept in days.  West Francia, our greatest enemy, has called a holy war for their former territory of Barcelona.  I have raised the banners, but can still only muster one man for every 5 that the enemy can.  Fortunately, all my hard work over the past decade has paid off.  I sent heralds to my allies asking them to uphold the alliances I have forged.  Tens of thousands of men are rushing to our aid, including many sell swords.

[19 April, 1006](http://i.imgur.com/SsNLbku.jpg)

I have done a very bad thing this day.  While waiting for my army to assemble, I took some time to inquire about my sons.  I am growing in age and will need a suitable replacement.  We will need a skilled diplomat to keep the realm from bleeding.  I spent a few days with my first son and heir, [Beltran](http://i.imgur.com/sYoIukG.jpg).  I could not believe my eyes.  Though thoroughly skilled in the lists and in battle, he is an imbecile.  Beltran is lazy, wroth, and even worse - can not handle the intricacies of court whatsoever.  After many sleepless nights, I knew that my second son, Belasko, should succeed me.  He excels better than my own self at court, and he has an incredibly virtuous lifestyle.  And so, though it violated all laws of gods and men, I had Beltran imprisoned and then executed.  It was not popular with the people, nor with my councilors.  Even my own kin hates me know.  But though they can not see it, everything I do is for the realm. 

[14 July, 1006](http://i.imgur.com/8KmkcsP.jpg)

Today I have a grandchild.  Hopefully my heir's heir.  There has never been a more beautiful babe, he will woo the hearts of many women and bring great glory to our house, I can tell.

All of these distractions of the past few months have made me sway from our primary goal.  The Francians and their alliance of nearly half of Europe still plague our lands.  In the end however, we [prevailed](http://i.imgur.com/DTmK6q0.jpg). 

[7 September, 1007](http://i.imgur.com/RnQ4VnX.jpg)

Though they begged for mercy, I pursued my enemy into his own lands.  As we came upon the grand city of Paris, I instructed my army to sack the city.  Free reign was given to the men to burn their homes, rape their women, and raze the city to the ground.  As far as I know, I am the first Muslim to have sacked a city so far North.  The history books will remember me and House Neffarako for this day.  Bloodied and wounded, their King was carried before me and propped up on his knees.  As he looked up into my eyes, he pleaded for mercy and [surrendered](http://i.imgur.com/ILAb7Sq.jpg).  I have done good this day.

[14 December, 1007](http://i.imgur.com/DCZxfIG.jpg)

I thirst for battle.  It has scarce been two moons since I have pushed back the Northern invaders, and I have already set my sights to the West.  King Jean of Austurias is weak, and with all the men at my back it would be wasteful to not take this opportunity and expand our lands. The fools couldn't even put up a [fight](http://i.imgur.com/qtHPrvN.jpg).  I am happy, for our lands have now [tripled](http://i.imgur.com/XMUmQI8.jpg) under my reign and we are now a force to be reckoned with.

[22 December, 1009](http://i.imgur.com/i96Oxed.jpg)

Strange, pale men from the far North landed on the shores of my homeland.  With them, an army to sack and pillage my people.

I threw them back into the sea.

[14 June, 1010](http://i.imgur.com/2nyIWCG.jpg)

The Caliph has called all holy men to reclaim Jerusalem from the Westerners.  I agree to help, but decide to first spend my energies elsewhere...

[22 July, 1011](http://i.imgur.com/rxF4smW.jpg)

Asturias has fractured even more.  Now is the chance to expand.  Iberia shall be ours.  I did not even have to call on my vassals to [win](http://i.imgur.com/fshBIRG.jpg).

[9 September, 1014](http://i.imgur.com/9z9Hvcr.jpg)

An opportunity has arisen to expand to a far away land.  The Christians are strong here.  While I will not sit in the shade of this tree I have planted, hopefully my son will, and his sons after that.

[15 February, 1015](http://i.imgur.com/Ce7dhhi.jpg)

Finally, at last I set foot upon the holy soil.  With my brothers in Allah around me, I finally take back land...that I will never [rule](http://i.imgur.com/vrJfOSy.jpg)?  A pity that I could not rule over this fair country.

[26 May, 1015](http://i.imgur.com/fs4Zk1G.jpg)

I do not feel well.  Breathing comes hard to me, and I know that my time has come.  Though I have not yet reigned for two decades, ruling has taken a great toll on my health.  I look back on all my accomplishments and know that I have brought great glory to House Neffarako.  I have done horrible things, but all for family and the realm.  In my last few months as I feel my strength ebbing away, I know that my son Belasko, the Second of His Name, will do a fine job ruling our fair land and expanding the horizons of Navare even farther.

I've been pretty good at securing my rule over southern Italy and up to rome if I can get my chancellor to forge a claim (by the way, why is it that the northern Italian provinces require a causus belli while the south has it built in?!? Freakin' annoying especially when it is coupled with the 10 year truces)

But when I try to expand into the south and east, I'll take a few provinces and then see that Islam can now call a jihad. A few months or years later, the caliph will call a jihad and I get viciously and repeatedly anally raped by caliph & co.

6f3o8x,Small rant about religious conversion and heresies,"So, I'm currently playing as Germanic. I've reformed my religion and stay between 95-100 moral authority. However, Old Germanic keeps popping up due to secret religious societies, although they never get above 3 moral authority. And by ""popping up"", I mean that 1/6-1/5 of my realm publicly converts and changes the land to Old Germanic.  
How is this possible? I haven't played since Conclave and I'm starting to see this function as a huge annoyance. I constantly have to revoke titles and turn to civil war. Anyone who publicly adopts the old ways are instantly revoked. Do they not know this? Why do they keep publicly adopting? The reformed religion is literally 33 times better than the old.
How can they instantly turn vast plots of land to the old ways with their 3 MA? My learned priests can't keep up with the spread of this vile heresy.  
I don't see other religions suffering from this problem. Take Catholicism, for example: I crushed these infidels to 60-75 MA and they only have 2/276 of their counties as heretical.  
I am a glorious emperor with the strongest religion in the world and my subjects repay me with treachery! With the power to imprison Charlemagne, butcher and rape his children, plunder and sack the likes of Rome, Constantinople, Paris, Carthage and Alexandria; but can't keep my sons from publicly adopting this 3 MA, embarrassment of a religion.  
Are my efforts to stomp out this heresy futile?

2nsnhv,This game is crazy!,"I just got the game today and I've been playing the tutorial mission. I knew that my king was going to die at 40 but I underestimated the sheer chaos that would break down afterwards.

I had a plot out to kill one of my brothers with it set to auto-gather people. I check up on it after awhile and notice that his wife is on the list. Some years later we finally kill him and I inherit the entire Castillan kingdom. Cool, things are going well. No one really hates me too much, then tragedy strikes. The King of Leon dies unexpectedly at 40 years old. 

His six year old son inherits the throne and the kingdom proceeds to get raped by regents and civil wars. For some reason despite them all more or less loving the king they HATE his son. I've fought off 3 or 4 civil wars, losing a bit of land after each time and end up with just my starting 4 or 5 counties. Then I get overthrown by some uncle I didnt even know I had and was relegated to being the lord of just one county. 

Sometime after that a group of loyalists springs up and before long I am replanted as the king of my original kingdom. Finally things are looking up again. I finally come of age and kick the regents out for ruining our country. I press a claim and reclaim about half of the land I had lost after the unification of the kingdom. Then all hell breaks loose, all of my neighbors decide they don't like me and I am forced to fight off two wars, one of which required a large amount of mercs, draining my coffers from about 2500 to just a couple hundred. I have managed to broker out white peace with both of them resulting in a net loss in prestige for them. It's been a wild ride and I'm curious where it will go next.

3aw6kl,Adapting Feudalism as a tribal superpower.,"Hello my Lords and Ladies.

Right now I am a Polish King with a country spanning from Hamburg to Volga. Basically, my kingdom is larger than Polish-Lituanian commonwealth was in its golden age. Catholicism was earlier introduced in the Volga regions, than it was in Hamburg.

However I seem to be currently in a trap of tribalism: I have to raid to get money (1$ a month from taxes is ridiculous), than those raided provinces just ask to be annexed, I get prestige, I get tribal troops, I raid more and my empire grows (mostly outside, as I dont get that much money to really reinvest it in province upgrades). Right now I have too many vassals and too many provinces (even with one duchy per nobleman).

But as soon as I try adopting feudalism everything falls apart: Vassals get pissed (that was expected) and everyone and their grandmother grab their swords because dinner is served and tonight we have for dinner some Polish borders with a side-serving of independence revolts.

Even with some savings (around 500 for mercs) the treasury quickly runs dry, so forget about upgrading the holdings.
Got a good period for reforms with a last monarch who lived for 81 years and had some good traits, but now as his grandson I first have to beat up my uncles to make sure they don't rebel.

So here's the question for you redditors: How to introduce feudalism in your tribal kingdom effectively (and don't tell me that I should've adapted it earlier when playing a small duchy, as it was impossible due to religion [would got raped the second after conversion]).",8,8,0,-0.2263,0.0,0.725,0.275,-0.6086,0.068,0.855,0.077
6drtzc,"A tale of treachery, bugs and general bullshittery.","So I'm doing a Scandinavian run right, minding my business from my little Danish kingdom when I get a fateful idea. Why not create Scandinavia? Might be fun, I already have a lot of land there. 

My little round alert thingy says I can create Sweden, Nirdriki and Danmark. I don't cause I smart. Gravelkind is a work of satan himself. Aight, got most of Finland, gotta be smart, the sumosokso magicians can pull phat stacks of reindeer molesters out of their asses just because fuck you thats why. 

Ok calm down, they supposed to be a pain in the ass, just wait for succession and attack them when they're low on mana to summon their fucking piece of-

Anyway, I wait for an opportune moment to strike. Got some sweet Estonian concubines from a recent conquest. Repelling the Pomeranian Magyars (don't ask) depleted his piety tanks. 

So I'm a happy guy, chilling with my nig- I mean courtiers in Saelland, having Jylland and Slesvig as well. 1 more county is needed. Kola. 300 piety no prestige. Shit son, gon tap that declare war button harder than my concubine's booty (who is your mother btw propabl, should have mentioned that). Norse conquest CB is proof that God (read: Odin) exists. 

My thugs are assembling. Oddr is Austergotland, the scariest mofo with an eye patch you've ever seen. His wife is of his dynasty, that's how little he gives a fuck. Hrorekr of Svithjod. That one has only one arm, no balls and a couple of voices in his head. Rumor has it he had a brave trait and one day caught a flu. Faste of Ost and Vestlandet. He murdered his own brother to get that second duchy. No one likes him. Plus he has diarrhea, fuck that guy. And last but not least my brother Arnfast who's gay. Everyone likes him anyway. But he don't like me cause my nose is ugly. In that it doesn't exist anymore, I had flu once as well. 

So the poor dude in bum fuck nowhere has a 4000 stack of bloothirsty norse bearded badasses coming his way, while he raised his deerfaggots, counting no more than 2800. Now to direct my drooling imbecils to actually siege his holding and not die of hunger due to being lost in the middle of some frozen shithole, wandering around aimlessly 'cause you're programmed by paradox. 

Cool, they're actually going there, neat. Now Imma need some coins to create my cute little empire so let's rape some Christians. I take my personal troops and ships and march them towards Venice. Near what will one day become a glorious Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, but now is a clusterfuck of random slavic duchies I remember that I forgot to tell my guys to ""rape, steal and gtfo"", rather than ""rape steal and some of you stay"". Back to shell-end we go. 

We finally get to some stealing, murdering and raping, the good times, even get to visit the pope. He gave us some bio-degradable blot-fuel to use in a couple of years, what a great guy. We had enough gold to create two empires, so we head back through the eastern Panama canal. This is the moment I get a message that I got scurvy. Yes, I was leading that army the whole time and now I'm bleeding from my teeth or something. I have no eligible doctors (honestly judging by the nature of the treatments anyone should be able to do it) so I pray. 

Yep, I died of scurvy like a little bitch, just outside my nearest port. Luckily my heir got all that prestige 'cause by Odin he' s gonna need it. Then I notice the full extent of the fuckery that has transpired here. 

Aight, lemme get a little technical. When the game sees you have all the land in the de jure kingdom, but the title doesn't exist, it gets created and passed to your sons. Howerev the game doesn't tell you that in the little ""title loss on succession"" thingy. So I lost Sweden. And Norway. But thats fine I have a claim on all of them right? Also one kingdom is missing, I noticed on the death screen one more kingdom. Nordriki right? I scroll to the north. Its not there. The little fucker took my capital. 

So as far as my knowledge of these mechanics go, usually if you have other titles to kill, gravelkind doesn't touch your primary duchy. But now it created a kingdom and gave it MY FUCKING CAPITAL and nothing else. And if you declare war on it using your claim gained on succession, well he still keeps the county. And you get tyranny for revoking it. You have to declare war for de jure within my duchy shit. So that was annoying. Moving my capital and dealing with that shit. No way that's intended, that's too retarded even by paradox standards. 

Also everyone hates me for some reason. I have too many duchies and can't give them away 'cause my council is autistic and are circle-jerking each other wirh favours. Then I got depressed. And my ruler also got depressed. So a master plan hatches in my mind. I did everything I wanted, fuck the council. I RULE DENMARK. I granted titles to whoever, executed half my vassals from the small rebellion that happened after succession. And the I killed myself. You're dead, you're revoked, you have a date with a bear, enjoy Savolax mr. Insane lunatic. And now that you all hate me, Imma jump off a balcony. Ragnarr, out. 

My new ruler is a 10 year old kid and since everyone hated my uncle I get about a million ""lower tribal org"" messages that I had to accept. But despite accepting about 5 of them during regency, it stayed at medium. Huh. After my 16 birthday I'm a shrewd, lustful young brilliant strategist. The world is my oyster. Also, berserker 'cause why not. 

So now I need to get Sweden and Norway Back. I have the leftover raiding prestige so no problem right? Well I'm just about to finish when I get a message from Estonia. The fucker is rebelling. Welp more blood for the blood god I guess. So I'm winning and everything when I notice more and more stacks of red people. Polish and Pomeranians. The whole world declared war on my rebelling deerfucking vassal. So I destroy them and get 100% warscore. Yeah enforce demands suckeeeer. No. Why? ""Some Polish cunt is holding some of his stuff"". Why do I care? How come he doesn't get the dreaded ""casus belli no longer valid"". 

Well I guess it's time for me to chase everyone else out of my rebel vassals territory, basically playing whack-a-mole with some Polish twats. 
After 8 years it's over. I have finally managed ro enforce demands before someone sieged a county on the other side of mr. too cool for Thor Estonian's territory. I organised a blot hoping he would be the lucky one to be sacrificed. No such luck. He died in the dungeon during the blot, he was 68, with cancer and depression. 

I stopped to think how it was for him, having your land taken away from you when you were young, valiantly defending it with all your strength, but tjen losing to a bunch of sweaty northeners with their cruel gods and customs. Fighting his whole life with outsiders, with cancer and injustice, for his right to believe what he wanted, and the freedom that was rightfully his. And in the end he drew his last breath, in the dungeon of a cruel, angry Dane, to the sound of his kinsmen and countrymen being sacrificed to their strange and monstrous gods, screaming and crying. I wondered a if it was him being the hero and I the villain, not the other way around as I thought.

By working hard, I managed to get, again, my capital in Palermo, with a nice crown of Sardinia, Tunis and Libia under my control. Sometimes my caliph in Misr helped me.

Thing is, keeping that was utterly impossible, after a few year I got again a holy war from the HRE, despite my Grand Vizir keeping always on shifting from HRE to Rome to Byzantium trying to keep everyone happy.

Dulcis in fundo, when I got expelled again from Sicily, some vassals rebelled, of course getting themselves a holy war from Pisa, so while I was trying to recapture them, those geniuses got raped by whole Europe United, ending themselves by their own choices...

..Well, I feel like there is a thing I, as a sadistic, son inprisoning, mother impregnating, sibling murdering, enemy slaughtering, peasent hating, majestic king, really need.

Being able to see which of your rulers over a full game, was the most fearsome beast, would really put things in perspective.

We have all heard/read about people like Stalinn, Hitler, Mao and Genghis Khan, killed off massive amounts of civilians.

Perhaps something with additional flavor events, like if you stay in a besieged town for more than 5 days after the siege, you get to choose between letting your troops entertain themselves (Rape the women!!), moving out (burn the village!!) or perhaps gather the children of the village before you, and then additional popups could be used to either chop them down or whatever you twisted mod makers can imagine.

Now obviously, raping, burning down or killing off the children, should have some effects on you as a leader. like +25% more love from vassels in the counties/duchys/kingdoms you already hold, and -25% from the newly conquered land.

I have a question for you.

I am currently playing Poland (Charlemange start as Greater Poland) and after a while I managed to finally form the kingdom of Poland (basically just kicked other polish duches asses and vassalised them).

After that I took my tribal principality for a spin, raiding and looting till I finally got enough money and piety to call myself a king. All was fine with the world.

And than, when I was conquering further and further reaches of eastern europe I noticed something. Raiding is OP. I took marshall troops, added my military force from mobilization and had some fun in Lithuania (country around 1,5 size of mine). By fun I do mean of course rape their entire countryside, and slaughter all and any troops that they thought of sending to their ""glorious conquest of pommerania"". After finishing last straggler I took my boys home, demobilized, declared war, mobilized again (added the 2500 troops for 500 prestige from tribal army event), invaded their still burning villages, and before you know it Lithuanian king now holds around 1/3 of what he had in the begining.

In the end isn't it a bit cheesy? I mean he can't retaliate (if I see that he has more troops than I do, I can simply retreat and raid some other neighbour), I have nothing to lose (his troops won't touch my countryside) and in the end combined with some basic intrigue, and dissent spreading I can topple any empire I so desire.
Nevermind even the 500 prestige penalty for those 2500 soldiers, after one conquest I make it back with profit. And if I get a local conflict (bishop rebelled) I can bring those guys for a full raiding rodeo, without the silly ""has to be at war"" requirement.

TL;DR Raiding as a pre-invasion crippling strike, op or not? Have I broken the system or what?",0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.8058,0.088,0.849,0.062
6l3nko,Wife does of explosive vomiting ! *GONE WRONG*,"Come near, oh you who want to hear the story of a poor unlucky fool whose vomitting wife was a poisoned gift !

4 years ago, I saw that my wife had a claim on the byzantine throne. Wonderful ! Our marriage is a regular one, so her heir is also mine, which means that wife + war + heir = T H I C C empire in a few years.

So there I go with my legions of crusading dudes, raping and pillaging everything we see. Constantinople on sight ! Time to rape and pillage RICH PEOPLE ! After a two year siege, the city falls to my unending streams of angry crusaders (we're orthodox christian too, so that's kinda the strange crusade). Warscore is at 85%, the current Basileos had to change then-shit covered pants many times since the end of the siege. Everything is fine.

But then, after a good session of ~~unjustified violence~~ cultural exchange, my steward reaches me kinda worried. Hm ? What's that ? There's a problem with my wife ? 

...You found her covered in vomit in her chamber ? And she's dead. Huh. What did you write in the reports ? ""Wife died explosively vomitting on the 6 april 1267"" ? Yeah that's ok. But uh, so we're done here ? Yes ? Well, ok boys, war's done, casus belli no longer valid, time to go home.

So after literally setting the whole Byzantine on fire, we just went away, to the pleasure of the ~~Greeks~~ Romans, I guess. No fancy latin crusader states, no muhamedians taking advantage on the situation, no turkey in the future. Just a big stack of disappointment/dead soldiers.

Thank you, explosively vomiting for wasting thousands of life just to die in your own puke. Oh well, I was fucking her sister anyway.",3,3,0,-0.628,0.0,0.629,0.371,-0.9874,0.105,0.71,0.185

6q50rn,Some memories from my first campaign,"Hi fellow redditors!

I was thinking about my first campaign(IIRC it was last year)in ck2 amd how much it was fucked up, weird and different from the normal campaigns. So i thought it was cool to share my memories (i don't have pics anymore tho). 

So, i hate tutorials. I never play the tutorial, expecially for Games i kinda know because i watched some let's play.
However i still wanted to play an easy character, so i decided to play the guy from the tutorial (Alfonso II of Leon IIRC) but without the tutorial part. 
Now, in case you don't  remember, Alfonso starts being the heir of kingdom of Galicia and Castille and has strong claims on these two kingdom because is their brother.
I began playing, tried to kill at least one of my brothers but not enough plot power so i gave up, thought ""Fuck it"", allied France and kicked Galicia's ass (also imprisoned my bro)
Meanwhile, Castile king dies in battle against the Emire of Aragon in an holy war he couldn't win so i inherited his country and with France's help defeated and usurped even the Emire's title. I came in control of all of Northern spain (besides Duchy pf Barcelona) in less than 5 years and by there it was pretty easy to unify all of Spain( even if some odd things kept happening, like having a king who figured out in 1100 that Earth revolves around Sun(no event chain tho, perhaps i did something wrong) got excommunicated then appointed an Antipope and made him actual Pope, Abbadid Empire taking over all of Southern Spain and myself having 3 homosexual rulers on a row) and form Hispania.

The fucked up part was the rest of the world:

William the conqueror failed in his war and England never got conquered (they even taked over Ireland and Scotland)

France lost a civil war and split apart, with some guy controlling France(and Iceland, somehow) and the Capet dinasty reigning in Aquitanie (then they died and the Duke of Toulouse got the Kingdom.) 
Conquered both part during end-game BTW

HRE became a fucking monster, conquering some parts of France, all of Denmark, a bit of Poland, Croatia and Rome. 55k army in 1400.
IIRC correctly they even won a crusade for Mauretania.

I won a crusade for Jerusalem and became the King.

Byzantine Empire lost a Jihad for Anatolia, but conquered all of Southern Italy in 1300 and also something in Balkans.

Croatia somehow became a Khanate(still a Feudal kingdom i mean, but with Cuman leaders and the title name changed) and conquered  North Africa and something in Caspian Sea, then got raped by Sicily that conquered everything besides the thing in Caspian sea(then Sicily lost Croatia and Southern Italy)

Mongols did absolutely nothing with a lot of border gore

Seljuks conquered Arabia and Pakistan but lost everything in Middle East

So, wasn't the weirdest campaign ever but expecially when you haven't olayed the game before and didn't know how things usually go in normal campaigns was ton of fun (i also built up Leon and made it bigger than Paris)

Do you have any funny first campaign story?

4wcqfa,How the fuck do you even live as Karen.,"Seriously.


I got the Old Gods a while back, and I decided, ""hey, xwedodah? That's great lets go Zoroastrian"" 


So I try out the Karen Satrapy. Oh boy. First time around I stay as a strong, independent satrap who doesn't need no-one to tell him he's beautiful.


Surprise surprise, its the fucking muslims. Fuck those guys. After every muslim leader and his four wives tries to rape me, I decided to quit. I also don't have the option to convert to muslim because GUESS WHICH DUMBASS THOUGHT SWORD OF ISLAM WAS UNNECCESSARY. THAT'S RIGHT, ME.


Well, I search the topic in this subreddit, and I see a bunch of people telling me I should bend over and swear fealty the the Samanids. Fine. Except now I can't holy war. Booooo. I take bukhara (as suggested). Except I also don't have conclave, so I can't force Khiva into elective and declare myself ruler. That's pretty shitty. I take like 2 more counties through claims then go for the independence war. 


BAM. First some shit-tier duchy declares a holy war on me for tabaristan. Cool, no biggie; but immediately after, the fucking saffarids decide they want in on the gangbang. The fucking saffarids, Mr.""Oh I want to invade all persia tee-hee"". I had about 2k gold in my coffers. Bought mercenaries. Fought back. I actually won the independance war. Of course, the fucking samanids joined the saffarid holy war right after. Then I ran out of gold from all that goddamn maintenance fees, and they STILL had bigger armies than me. Of course these oh-so loyal mercenaries decide they want out as soon as I run out of gold. So I was left with about 2500 troops against an angry saffarid/samanid invasion that was easily 2 times as large. 


I decided I was screwed, so I quit that game too. So, what gives? What can I do to stop holy wars? Seriously, I am so fucked every time I try playing as them. I really wanna do the whole zoroastrian persian empire thing but I'm finding it horribly difficult. Can anyone please help?

82183g,Zunist Run Update 2: Elective Bugaloo,"I should preface by saying the title is clickbait, no elective succession takes place.

So this is my [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/7u43d7/update_help_with_zunist_run/) where I was stressing about my homosexual, 60yo, male-childless ruler. Well fret not, he somehow miraculously pumped out three males before dying at 68.

Soon after he passed, the Great Holy War cooldown ended and Persia was the target of the new one. The weakened Abbasids were easy to defeat, despite my dull character. Succession was pretty regular from there, and that character even had a son become the Grandmaster of the Knights of the Sun.

He was followed by a devil worshiping military man, who was followed by a quick and ambitious-till-death Midas, who was followed by an equally able fortune builder and commander. All this time, I was still barely below 80% realm of the Persian Empire, but finally was able to create it in 1025 after great holy wars for Daylam and Transoxiana. This led to a period I dubbed the era of the Empires: Persia, Byzantium, Tibet, Bengal, Arabia, Hispania, and HRE were all in play and powerful.

I was able to marry my son to a claimant to the Tibetan Empire and landed him as a baron before pressing her claim and winning. Their heir then became the child emperor of Tibet and Persia. Unfortunately I was hit with a double whammy: Independence faction in Persia and a claimant faction in Tibet. Almost immediately I lost Tibet, and some internal territories in Persia. Strangely enough, some of my former vassals in Persia accepted my offer of vassalization, while those who refused were gang-raped by my vassals, healing the damages immensely.

Even with losing Tibet, I held on to Jinquan county (the beginning of the Silk Road in Tibet), and some Tibetan vassals remained Zunist. After a few generations Tibet splintered anyways and ceased to exist. Meanwhile my character was heartbroken enough to die of depression at 21, while his father (the only true ruler of both Tibet and Persia) was assassinated at 24.

During this time, Catholics moved into Africa and the HRE hesitantly into Hispania. I say hesitantly because there existed already several Catholic kingdoms in Spain at this point. Then the Byzantines moved into Mauritania, the steppes, the Holy Land, and eventually Nubia. The Seljuks rose to prominence right next to me in Transoxiana, but were easily defeated. The Mongols would much later rise and challenge me after some early successes, but they too would lose.

The Abbasids succumbed to a decadence revolt, who then themselves lost the entirety of the kingdom of Arabia to the Hashimids, the true heirs of Mohamed. The Arabian Empire ceased to exist soon after, and the Caliphate belonged to the Hashimids. The Shi'a has long since disappeared by this point and would never reappear. The Byzantines would then move into the Hashimids' Arabia soon after.

I should note that the Byzantine Empire itself was constantly attacking me (and losing), but the powerful kingdom vassals were the ones truly expanding the Empire. This will come into play later.

The Bengal Empire ruled nearly the entirety of the subcontinent of India by this point and I had many back and forths with them. They and the Byzantine Empire became my only true equals.

The history of the Zunbil Empire becomes pretty boring at this point with myself just doing some internal things like ending peasant revolts, building up holdings, chasing away looting nomads, etc. Ironically enough, during this 100 year gap of peace, there were only two rulers, who themselves weren't anything spectacular. After their deaths, the new emperor was an adept man of intrigue which meant only one thing: another stint with the the devil worshipers. It was short lived and uninteresting though, and upon his death to weak physique left the empire to his child son.

A tragedy then ensues that hits too close to home: he started showing symptoms of disease only to find out he had childhood cancer. He was a righteous, although uninteresting, man who died at 19. The throne then passed to his brother, a dutiful cleric who led troops against the Mohammedan and Catholics in Egypt in great holy wars. He wasn't too skilled though, and died in battle when defending against an ill attempted Jihad called by the Hashimids.

His child heir was slow, but that didn't stop me from trying to bring him to greatness; he learned to be an ambitious and shrewd, as well as temperate, fortune builder accumulating in 19 stewardship showing that you can work through your disabilities. Nonetheless, his half-brother, child-of-a-concubine had him assassinated at age 22. This brother was the one led his troops victoriously against the Mongols, yet died near the end of the war. One of his greatest accomplishments was capturing Subotai in battle.

His infant son would become a mishmash of traits: a fortune builder, greedy, lustful, content, craven, temperate, paranoid, and later while plotting the death of an adventurer claimant and family member, became a familial kinslayer. This got him a rival who he attempted to duel, only to die by the blade of. Fortunately this was only a month after his newborn son was born, so the dynasty continued.

This new emperor watched as the Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica became independent of the Byzantines through an easily won war, thus goring up the borders of the ERE, at least in the traditional homeland of Greece, the Balkans, and Anatolia. This new emperor also contracted early, although not childhood, cancer. Fortunately he had a son despite the disease's -20% fertility and lived long enough to instruct him to become a tough soldier. He soon died, which brings me to my present character.

He has become a diligent and ambitious, although shy, member of the Hermetic Society, who has been the grace of Zun been given a robust physique while trodding the desert in His rays. He also was instructed in cynicism and bravery by his cancer ridden father, who had succumbed at 26 despite a successful experimental treatment. He experiments in his lab while he watches another massive Byzantine independence revolt that is likely to bordergore the Earth even more.

7175mb,The Rise of Sweden - The Reign Of King Alfr,"It was 766.  He barely remembered the day of his coronation, proof that he had grown old. He was 27 when the crown had been placed on his head after his fathers natural death. He was an ambitious lad, and dreamed of uniting Scandinavia. 

There was one thing he did remember from the ceremony, however. Asa.

During the feast they had conversed while sipping wine, and after eating would share a dance. Late into the party they slipped out and ran to his chambers. They were both only 16. He didn't remember what happened after that, but he remembered waking up next to her. They were madly in love, but she had been betrothed to the king of Sapmi. 

Over the next 2 years of his reign, he had plotted against the king. He wanted to see him dead so he could marry Asa. He made 3 attempts before he found out that Asa was pregnant. She fled to his court with the news. But that wasn't the only news that she brought. 

The King of Sapmi had claimed that he had kidnapped her, starting a diplomatic crisis. bordering Swedish states joined a coalition against him, and by 771, war had broken out. All of the nations around them were fully mobilized. He brought Asa to his castle, and kissed her goodbye. He then left, flanked by 300 soldiers, has he marched through the streets which were lined with his army.

He reached the front, and pivoted around. ""Deus Vult!"" while thrusting his sword into the air.  The crowd erupted into a battle cry. 

Alfr mounted his horse with his guard, and charged, while the army chanted ""To war!""

It was 772 when he had taken out Sapmi. His troops showed no mercy. They pillaged their cities and farms, and raped their women until they surrendered. 

By 775, his occupation spanned the entirety of Sweden.

When he got to the last capital, he found the kings and queens in a bunker. He would bring them to their capitals, and behead them in public, personally beheading the King of Sapmi in his own capital.

He would annex the countries one by one in wars after this, and then annex northern Finland.

He married Asa, and with her had 10 children. 8 boys, 2 girls.

His realm prospered for a short time. But then, he fell ill. Seeing the possibility of his death, he gathered all of his children. The girls were escorted out after a short speech.

Then he glanced at the guards, who seized all of his boys but one. The boys put up a fight, his oldest was guarded from the boys who tried to kill him in anger.  The fight soon ended, and all of the boys were brought to a dungeon. Alfr got to the height of his sickness, when he ordered their executions. 6 were killed, but one managed to slip out. His second son, whos name will be permanently burned into his soul. ""Skuli"". He fled to the Karellian court, where he campaigned for war with Sweden.

Alfr didn't die, however, although his mind took a hit. He resumed his duties with a sour taste, he was no longer the ambitious child who had first inherited the throne. His wife, overcome by grief, hung herself in there bedroom. He was the one to find her. After this he took many concubines, but the passion was gone. The next 20 years of his life were uneventful, his realm prospered, but he suffered from severe stress. He created the kingdom of Sweden and crowned himself king, but the joy of achieving his ambitions wasn't there. He lost his zest for life. 

He was sleeping in, when one die someone burst through his door and screamed ""WAR!""

He jumped out of his bed and grabbed his sword. The courtier through up his hand and said

""War, we, we are at war, with Denmark""

His carelessness quickly dissolved. ""Raise the levies.""

He got dress and burst through the door, a fire in his heart reflecting in his eyes. He moved forward on a horse. This time with no guard. He didn't care if he lived or died. But he wouldn't die for nothing. He would fight to the very last man, and if that very last man was himself, he would accept his fate.

He took a deep breath.

""DEUS VAULT!"" He shouted louder than ever before. ""TO WAR! TO WAR I SAY! WE SHALL FIGHT FOR THE GLORIOUS NATION OF SWEDEN!"" He cried out, as his galloped through the streets. The soldiers ran after him. Their morale was so high that they ran for an entire 3 hours before reducing to a march.

They saw a Danish army in one of their Southern provinces. The Swedish archers took up positions behind a hill, his cavalry got in their triangular position, and the infantry prepared to run out. 

The 3 triangular formations were ready to charge, led by Alfr himself, at the tip of the center one.

The archers rained arrows on the enemy lines, catching them by surprise. ""DEUS VULT!""

He charged forward, their archers trying to hit him. He hit the first line and killed 100 men. The following cavalry killed another 300. They broke their lines, the army of only 1000 men was almost winning against the army of 3000. The infantry charged out, as the cavalry broke their position and began killing the soldiers one by one.

The Infantry slaughtered an additional 1000.

2000 men arrived to re enforce, and the Swedes retreated.

It inspired the nation, who formed their own militias to fight in the fields. 

They continued to push the swedes back, but they never surrendered. A resistance was brewing.

When in 812, the militas flocked to Stockholm. The last strong hold of sweden was at its heels, when an army of warriors rallied, 3000 men pushed back the Danes. After that point they didn't lose once. By the end of the war, they had slain 20,000 Danes. They took Danish Sweden and Sjaelland. 

He remembered his son, who was living in exile in Karaelia. Filled with regret, he invited him back to court. He refused.

More Grandchildren were born, and he decided to spend more time with family. He wanted his grand children to not come to the same fate as his children.

He took many lovers and had many more daughters himself, who would bear him more grandchildren. Then, on a cold day in 842, a raid occurred. the Karelians had raided Stockholm, and taken 12 of his grand children captive. He managed to escape, but seeing his grandchildren dissapear brought on more depression. They marched the children to the center of town, where his son, his own son, Skuli, beheaded his neices and nephews. He made them say their name, and let them utter their last words. His men dragged me out to watch. By the end of the week they had left, and they had left me alive. I prepared a defense, waiting for the next raid, he would kill Skuli himself. 

He waited 2 years, and then the raid finally came. The army was repulsed, Skuli, seeing his capture inevitable, used his last division of 10 men, to inflitrate the tower, hearing this, Alfr ran up the stairs. Skuli chasing after him, he was 70, but was still in good health. He got to the top, and realized he had no where else to run. He stared over the edge, he heard them thundering up the stairs 40 steps down. He could barely see the bottom. All of this flashed through his mind as he stepped onto the wall blocking him from the ground. 

He balanced himself on the wall.

He heard the trap door slam open, and, he jumped. He fell towards the ground. And in the few seconds he was falling for, he muttered ""Alea iacta est"" before dying.

The men took off their masks. Revealing his 2 living sons, and their own armies.

After a holy war for the county directly south and a lucky holy war against Aleppo (was rebelling) I was almost about to form the greek orthodox Kingdom of Syria (this is what we in the literary community call foreshadowing). Alas, it was not to be. The Egyptians decided that the Kingdom of Syria would be a fantastic addition to Shiism and promptly invaded. After getting my (and the entirety of Byzantium's) ass handed to me, I was all set to see my first ""You Lose"" screen (at least, my first in 500+ hours of practice) and was already thinking of playing Aragon, or possibly Barcelona. Through an act of divine will (or devilry) I was spared death at the cost of merely my single duchy, leaving me quite secure with several counties under my control. I was placed under the governance of a foreign emir and to prevent my head becoming disconnected from my general being, I became an Egyptian (I could not become a Shia Muslim as I do not have that expansion). I got sick of having an inferior as a master and declared independence...from my Emir (I'm not a moron). That was easy enough, and I usurped the Emirate of Aleppo (being conquered was rather distracting, so they were able to sneak off). I'm feeling quite pleased with myself; besides the minor upheavals, I was stable, decently sized, and looking to grow, especially under my sons, who were to be Muslims unlike myself (apparently, you can't inherit without the expansion although that would prove irrelevant). I was pretty cozy with the Sultan; he was married to my half-sister and he was raising my kids, unfortunately, this did nothing to stop him from revoking one of my counties. No big deal, he'd done it once before, and I still had the duchy so I'm fairly okay. And then he revoked another...and another...each time, the pop-up mocked me with it's ultimatum of death or dishonor, each time I was forced to soil my ancient name, and it was after he had revoked all of my non-capital counties that I despaired. And then he revoked my barony, within the capital at Aleppo. And then he revoked my capital, leaving me without holdings, and in the eyes of history, extinguished. 

Questions: 
1. How the fuck did I survive the initial Jihad?
2. Why did he continue revoking my titles? (I noticed it was a gold revocation notification so i assume it was a plot).
3. I've left the auto saves and might consider re-trying from a previous save (or starting over from 1066); how do I avoid all of this shit/not get raped by the cruelty of the desert?

3byt64,TIP: How to adopt feodalism or make a republic without reformation.,"So, yeah, this is kinda easy and somewhat obvious, but I had a conversation with two of my friends who play CK2, and this was new for them, so this may be interesting for anybody else, especially for the new players.

The easiest way to change your government type fast and easy is to conquest some holdings with desired type and move your capital there. But what if you are a slavic warlord who want to start a merchant republic? It's a long walk to Venice...

Lets say you want to start an Icelandic merchant republic right now and don't want to fight for the control of holy sites?

1. You need a properly developed holding and maximum tribal organization, so rape and pillage, pass laws and upgrade.
2. You need a big pile of piety (around 1500), so... rape and pillage, sacrifice, build zeal.
3. Get yourself a christian or muslim concubine. You guessed it! Rape and pillage!
4. Be sure that your capital have the religion you want to have after the conversion, that it is properly developed and that you have enough piety and right concubine.
5. Make a decision to convert to you concubines religion and change your government type. At this point, if you want to play as Wali-Emir of the republic of Iceland, you can skip the 6 and 7.
6. Now take the decision to conver to the religion of your capital(this will consume most of the piety you need). Voila! You now have a merchant republic of Iceland withold north faith(with pagan attrition ans subjugation).
7. Rape, pillage, build trade posts for Odin!
8. ...?

1r0abc,The new combat system does not work...,"The new combat system does not work in favour of smaller kingdoms like it was planned because the more troops the enemy has the faster the flank falls and the dmg bonus is (probably historically accurate not sure) is To much. I saw Cummania not loose more then 100 men in 10k vs 7k. I managed to drag down the levy of cummania down to 7k and then hired mercs so I was at about 4,5k men and they had major river crossing penalty and then they  lost about 800 men while my army was obliterated.

They also need to rebalance these revolts while playing under France I saw Lothringa get a liberation revolt which had 16k men while the max levy of lothringa was 5k. And they did not disband after they raped Lothringa so a 4 county kingdom was almost as strong as the Shia caliphate that controlled arabia,mesopotamia and almost all of persia and this is rich land btw. 

Then there are religous peasant revolts that are 3 times as big as your levy at full and you are then loosing 5% moral authority and 500 prestige and 500 piety YAY.",4,4,0,-0.34,0.0,0.714,0.286,-0.5965,0.097,0.788,0.114
1s4p31,Can anyone give me some advice about my Ironman Khazar playthrough?,"[Here's](http://imgur.com/D21scma) my current status, as you can see, I survived the initial rape fest and have pushed the Tengri horselords back. 

Now what I wanted help about was whether or not I should form Kingdoms, even with 500 hours into CK2 I don't really get the advantages vs the disadvantages of holding multiple kingdoms besides the obvious prestige bonuses. 

Also, given my situation, anyone have any advice about how to go further? I'm thinking of destroying Cumania once more (I took Turkmenistan previously) before heading down to Georgia, basically trying to expand as far away from where the Seljuks will show up. I'm sort of worried though because I got this far before and then misclicked and lost everything, so any help would be appreciated.

3nhrrl,Can we please ban Anime Portraits from this subreddit? Every time someone posts it I throw up a little in my mouth.,"I am sick and tired of all the stupid Anime portraits bullshit showing up in this sub and I **can't** be in the minority on this. Seeing these badly-drawn faces, all it does is make me cringe and feel sorry for whichever loser is wasting away their life drawing such garbage. 

It makes ABSOLUTELY no sense to take a game like CK2 and make it 'Anime', something with no relation to the source material whatsoever. Making a Bob's Burgers mod or the Simpson style would make just as much sense, hell, even **more** sense, and **wouldn't** make my eyes feel like they are being raped.

People make the argument ""But I like not having a triple chin."" No, shut up. You're missing the point of CK2. It's about being a diverse, realistic character with real flaws navigating through one of the most tumultuous periods of cultural history. Your character has a triple chin? Play a gluttonous, greedy lecher. You want the game to display when characters have the ugly/attractive traits? There are plenty of portrait improvement mods you can try out **without** having to install shitty anime faces that look like they were drawn in the margin of a middle school notebook.

I thought I would wait it out until the novelty of this cringe-inducing trash dies out but I can't wait any longer. Sorry if you actually like Anime faces (wtf is wrong with you??), but if you do you should really just create your own sub and leave the rest of us the fuck alone.

3ete5j,Seriously they should balance the chance of imprisonment. Currently its ridiculous!!!,"Did you remember plundering and besieging Constantinople around six times until you captured that one byzantine princess you liked to make your concubine? 

It was annoying, but balanced. 

Those times are over and thats not a good thing. Playing a horde khan made me furious beyond description as i realized: **EVERY SINGLE MOTHERF----NG TIME** my capital gets sieged down, by random plunderparties/ rebellarmies/ someone who feels like it **EVERY SINGLE ONE** of my female courtiers gets imprisoned. 

One might think they present the khans wife/daughter/sister/female relative on a silver plate to everyone who randomly passes by. ""Hey, wanna steal my liege's daughter to rape her furiously? Here she is, he won't be able to do anything cause his army needs one extra day to arrive. We didn't even bother saving/hiding her to make it easier for you.""

Note: your vassal or tributaries vassal can plunder your capital and take your women as concubine, and you don't even get a casus belli or reason for imprisonment.

And then things are getting even more pathetic: One time I got revenge by sieging his camp and took all is females.

What happened? 

We both held each others wifes/ concubines/daughters hostage, but nobody was able to mediate a Prisoner exchange (Feature needed beyond repair), nor to buy their freedom, as 110 per female are beyond anyones earlygame purse.

So the alan whoreson started blinding my women... one after the other, first my wife.... then my concubines.... then my sweet little daughters (2* strong + 1* genius + 1* normal).
Something snapped inside me. For every blinding I executed one of his. I even attacked his liege, just to make him landless and killed anyone of that family I could reach.

Please make it more balanced, or I will devolve into a cruel sociopath, blinding, raping, castrating, and seduce the relatives and wifes of and everyone I can get my hands on.... well, I mean more than usual

u3cups,The rebirth of Egypt,"This campaign took quite some time but it was fun through and through…all the way up until I had to conquer South West Africa, that was a major pain.

\*\*some pictures in the bottom of this massive wall of text\*\*

We start in 867 as the count of Sout Kordofan, a Kushite ruler in the fractured land of Darfur (Technically if you want to make it even more “historical” you can go with a Nubian Kushite start but I somehow ended up in Darfur).

I hope you enjoy reading about the rebirth of Egypt:

“Drumroll, curtains unfurling, grand fanfare…”

The early days were hard for the isolated practitioners of the old Gods of the Nile, surrounded by hostile faiths and harsh lands, each day was a fight for survival.

But the count was no fool, in fact, his lifestyle dictated by his belief in Wepwawet and his extensive knowledge of the art of medicine helped him and his people greatly. People from far and wide flocked to this man of wisdom, seeking reprieve from ailments and guidance during times of strife. The count was content with his lot in life, but destiny, destiny had other plans.

Starting sometime in 868 the tribes from West Kordofan raided his village, killed many and burned their crops in a night of violence and tragedy. In the aftermath, the count wept, for the sacred shrines of the Gods were defiled. Amidst the blaze of the shrine a figure appeared:

“Thou shall go forth and bring justice to the perpetrators,” the voice boomed towards the shocked man: “Thou shall go forth, under the guidance of the almighty Sun and with swift vengeance of the Jackal!”

The count, shocked and in awe spoke no words. He knew what he had to do; his goal was clear. West Kordofan will fall.

The next day all those faithful to the old Gods marched out through the heat of the day and brought terror to the perpetrators of the raids. The west could not hold and soon, with their leaders killed the tribes joined with the south underneath the now newly proclaimed Duke of Kordofan.

But as blood was now tasted the Duke did not stop, he expanded, further and further he drove his army of believers, spreading the true word of the Jackal and the grace of the Sun across the plain of Africa.

But alas, at the old age of 80, the wise man was finally called into the Jackal's embrace, starting but never finishing his task. However, the foundations were set, their faith stronger than ever and his line secure in a wise and just son.

The son continued with the task of his great father and soon all in the land bowed to him as the one true King as anointed by the Jackal and graced by the great everlasting Sun. The king in Darfur reigned supreme, none able to challenge his claim or check his might.

Years passed with constant war, the loot and slaves fuelling a booming economy in the lands of the King. Hise wise and enlightened rule permeated every facet of society. New farming techniques were discovered, ideas from conquered lands were absorbed and the Kushite faith was reformed in light of the changes in society and the social order. Soon the King saw the transformation of his tribal subjects into feudal serfs, yet the Daju people never had time to dwell on their lot in life, as the glorious age of expansion fed all no matter their station or their gender into the massive war machine that was the Jackal’s horde of the African plains.

Further and further the lands of the King were extended, there was no one that could face him and live. In the West Kanem bent the knee to the King of Darfur and in the East Ajuraan, Hiraab and Hafun submitted without a fight. Seeing these great tribes bow most of the horn of Africa submitted to the great Jackal, as he was now known, for only a God or the son of a God could achieve such great deeds in his life.

However, there were some who dared to resist and who had a chance of withstanding the great African tide. The great Jackal King looked to the North, where the bountiful lands of the mother Nile, the ancestor home of the old Gods withered under the Crescent moon and the midnight star.

The old Abbasid Caliphate was long gone, yet the house of Muhammadid held supreme power, unchallenged and resolute all from the sands of old Egypt, through the shores of the Levant and into the ancestral lands of the Arabian desert. The Prophet’s peoples enjoyed a golden age, their culture unmatched by any other and in awe of the barbarous Latins that inhabited the burning wreckage of the once-mighty Roman Eagle. Yet darkness loomed on the horizon for the faithful of the Prophet as preachers of the Cross chanted: “Death to the heathens!” and its warriors replied: “Deus vult!”

Legions of Latins crossed the sea, descending in an orgy of violence across the Levant, burning, raping, pillaging in the name of the Cross. The knights of the cold North crossed blades with the scimitars of the desert in countless battles, with the dead numbered by the thousands feeding carrion birds and colouring the sands red with the blood of the faithful.

As the two behemoths of their respective faiths clashed the now elderly Jackal King watched with glee, his army swelling with new followers by the day. He amassed his forces in the Nubian lands just south of the birth of the great Nile, he watched, he waited. For once the Cross had sufficiently blunted the scimitar of the Crescent moon the Jackal King would strike, tearing into the side of the exhausted foe, devouring him like a pack of rabid animals.

In 1065 the Latins were defeated, the Prophet’s peoples stood firm, yet they were exhausted, their lands were burned, their cities in ruins, it was time for the Jackal to strike.

Swift was the Jackal’s strike, his army swept through the Nile’s fertile lands, its peoples left defenceless and weak in the aftermath of the great holy war. The caliph was taken by surprise, he hastily mustered his armies and met the great Jackal King at the walls of Cairo, his rule of these lands challenged once again.

The two armies met in such a force that the Nile ran red as never before, the dead carried into the sea by the great nourishing waters that once filled these lands with an abundance of life. Both sides fought with a murderous zeal, each warrior calling forth the strength of his God to smite down the unbeliever that dared challenge him. Time and time again the name of the Great Jackal was invoked to meet the scimitars of the one God, ending with the death of the faithful on both sides.

It felt as if the world itself is ending in those days, that humanity will feed a never-ending stream of men into the grinder at the banks of the Nile, yet the fighting did not stop. In the end, the Empire of the Arabian desert, too exhausted from its fight with the Latins to withstand this second tide emanating from the south of the continent, slowly lost ground, yet they made the invader pay dearly for each foot of land taken. Cairo fell in the second year of this war and the Caliph was forced to withdraw his troops from the plains of Egypt all the way across the Sinai.

It pained the Caliph dearly but there was no point in continuing the fight. Divisions and unrest within his lands forced him to make peace with the Great Jackal, the price of peace, the bountiful lands of Egypt, the breadbasket of empires both ancient and new.

And so it was that in 1072 the Kingdom of Egypt was wrestled from the hands of the Prophet’s faithful and embraced by the newly established and rejuvenated Empire of Egypt, under the Great Jackal, the sword of Wepwawet, the descendent of the Sun and the conqueror of Africa.

Yet just as with his great father the new Emperor did not enjoy his accolades for long. For after a lifetime of warfare and service to the old Gods, the Great Jackal was called into the embrace of his godly ancestors and his great spirit shed his mortal coils, living behind a legend that will permeate all of human history henceforth.

His descendants were many and the Great Jackal’s line was solid. Both men and women sat on the Nile’s throne in Cairo, each adding their own accomplishment to the great mosaic that was the Empire of Egypt. Soon the peoples of Egypt and the peoples of Africa were joined in a union as a new culture developed in the melting pot that was the land of the Nile. The Nile fed them and the people expanded, sheltered under the glory of their Jackal emperors and united in faith to Wepwawet the great and all-conquering.

Decades passed, wars were waged and lands were gained. Then in 1245, after centuries of near-constant expansion, the great Ankhesenamun, High Priestess of the Kushites, daughter of the most illustrious line blessed by the Jackal God felled her last enemy in Africa and declared that Africa was henceforth united under the glory of the Great Jackal and the Everlasting Sun, never to be torn asunder.

And so continued the Golden age of Egypt, reborn Empire of the Nile, never faltering in its faith to the Gods in the face of any opponent.

Yet, as history teaches us, Empires rise and fall, and far to the East, the hooves of the horse lords can be heard thundering through the Asian steps, eager to unite the world under the banner of the Eternal Blue Heaven.

70z38j,A comprehensive and summarical list of all Crusader Kings Two DLCs.,"Someone asks what DLCS they should buy Every. Single. Week. So just read this and pick the ones that work for you. 

Sword of Islam: Play as powerful Muslim Sultanates and Caliphates and watch how your incredibly overpowered sucsession and changing laws only by using piety(no more voting BS) is toppled in a massive uprising of half of your entire realm because your second cousin Emir Ali drinks on weekends.

Legacy of Rome: If you are the kind of person to not pitch tent when watching pornos but the mere mention of the Roman Empire makes all your blood rush down south, this is the mod for you. Added benefit: A-historical 500 years too early standing armies come as a bonus.

Sunset Invasion: If you hate Western Europe, Clean Borders, Historical Accuracy, and Logic and absolutely fucking love human sacrifice than this is the DLC for you!

The Republic: If you ever felt like there isn't enough methodical genocide and your favorite crusade was the 4th. 

The Old Gods: If you just LOVE to have family members and random people invade you periodically for most if not all of your lands and peasant revolts in iceland somehow breeding to five times the historical population and gaining extremely competent leaders and tons of high grade weaponry. Also fun if you love raping, pillaging, even more incest, and gavelkind!

Sons of Abraham: Absolutely recomended for people who want to screw over everyone else using the most screwed over peoples in history, the Jews. Also great if you want your strong genius son to repeatedly desire to join a holy order and disinherit themselves and losing all your piety if you refuse, make vassalizing the pope equivalent to a game hack, and have random courtiers trying to constantly convert you!

Rajas of India: If you absolutely god damned love INDIA and bought Crusader Kings Two, a game focusing around the Crusades, to play as a nation in INDIA. 

Charlemagne: If you want to be feudal before it was cool, want a massive hostile blob on both sides of the map, and have your liege give you a bitchin title only for it to revert back to him upon your death. 

Way of Life: If you were meaning to buy Sims but accidently bought this.

>In the year 768, a man named Charles (or Karl) became King of the Franks and though he did not know it at the time, he would be remembered for centuries to come as the father of Europe. Charles would go on to conquer an Empire spanning all of France, western Germany, and most of Italy. Charles would go down as Charles the Great or Charlemagne and his descendants would rule Europe for centuries. Though over time the realms of Charlemagne were taken over by other cadet branches and dynasties such as the Capets and the Ottovian Emperors. By the year 1066, the House of Karling was nearly extinct. The only direct male heir of Charlemagne left was Count Herbert of Vermandois along with his unlanded brothers and son. The last remaining son of the Father of Europe.  
>  
>This is an AAR or After Action Report for Crusader Kings 2 (CKII). CKII is a medieval politics simulator taking place across the middle ages as far back as 769 all the way to 1453. In this AAR I will be telling the story of my campaign taking place between 1066 and 1444. Unlike in most historical strategy games, in CKII you play not as a single nation but as a continuous bloodline and dynasty. There is a lot more focus on the roleplaying aspects of these rulers lives as you’ll see.  
>  
>In this particular AAR I will be playing probably one of the most famous dynasties in Medieval history, the House of Karling (more famously known as the Carolingian Dynasty). These are the direct descendants of Charlemagne, the King of Franks, first Holy Roman Emperor, and the man basically responsible for the existence of France and Germany (and by extension Western Europe as we know it). Of course as time has passed the Karlings have slowly lost their positions of power as other families have risen up through marriage, rebellion, and conquests. We will be playing Count Herbert of Vermandois. Herbert is a subject of the French King and also the last landed member of the House of Karling. His son and his two brothers along with him are the last direct male descendants of Charlemagne. Historically, Herberts only son ended up passing without having any children thus ending the Karling lineage. With us at the helm, we can hopefully not only keep the legacy of Charlemagne going but restore the Karlings to the French crown where they rightfully belong.

# The 11th Century: The End of an Age

&#x200B;

[Europe c. 26th of December, 1066](https://preview.redd.it/091tie1xw5351.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a3e6e051c43f44131f5e49a37c0070dd6504e411)

Europe by the later half of the 11th century was seeing large shifts that would go on to define its history. The Age of the Vikings had come to an end when King Harold Godwinson of England defeated the Norwegian invaders in the Battle of Stamford Bridge earlier this year. William the Conqueror and his Norman armies successfully invaded England and established their rule which would mark the start of the transition from the germanic Anglo-Saxon language and culture to a more Norman French English culture. Iberia is in the midst of the reconquista which can decide the religious fate of the peninsula. The Eastern Roman Empire is facing an invasion by the Seljuk Turks who rule over Persia which can possibly mark the beginning of their long decline should the Turks succeed. Europe is about to find itself in the midst of the investiture crisis where rulers such as the Holy Roman Emperor will challenge how much power the Papacy actually has as many rulers will decide that secular rulers should be able to appoint bishops instead of the Pope. Meanwhile as the Muslims advance on the Christian Byzantines, and Eastern Orthodoxy expands into the western Eurasian Steppe with Kievan Rus, the Papacy will begin to feel especially threatened. This feeling could culminate by the end of the century into drastic matters to expand Catholicism's reach and influence by force even. Lastly France is finding itself in a rough position. King Philippe and his younger brother Hughes are the last of the Capet rulers, both being children. France is a powerful kingdom indeed but the Holy Roman Emperor to their east is vastly superior in strength and numbers. France could very well see its territory begin to shrink away over the course of the next several years from German invasions. And in the midst of all of this is a 34 year old Count looking to carve out his own place in what is becoming an increasingly chaotic time.

**1st of January, 1067**

A big day for my family indeed. My brother Eudes married today in Florence. Duchess Matilda of Tuscany, 20 year old Italian woman, incredibly patient and hard working woman. She certainly takes her role as a ruler of one of the largest holdings in the Holy Roman Empire very seriously. Honestly, she is an ill fit for my brother. Always jealous of my privilege of being the first born, preferring to hide away from his duties and stuff his face with expensive roasts on my coin. Honestly to be rid of him all the way here is a blessing. Adele and I attended the wedding of course and gave the honorable Duchess a gift. Considering my family's lands are limited to a simple county in northern France, having a Karling rule over most of Italy will hopefully bring back some honor to our family name. 

**11th of January, 1067**

Apparently there has been a request delivered to me. A nun who has earned the name Melisende the Holy from Laon has earned quite the reputation as a healer caring for Lepers. Apparently the Leper Colony where she works as well as her convent has run into financial issues. The letter was asking for me to offer some coin in donation to the convent in exchange she had offered her services as a healer and practitioner of medicine to my court. Truly a remarkable woman based on the recommendation. I speak with my steward to make the arrangements. It’d be nice to have a court physician to look after me and my family.

**23rd of January, 1067**

There was an emergency meeting of the Regency Council called in Paris. It seems a declaration of war was sent to us by Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich IV as he planned to invade France to seize the county of Zeeland. Of course the council knew that this was more of a show of force against the Kingdom, an attempt to seize some glory. The council began making decisions on how to move the French armies in preparation for the war. The Emperor has access to a much larger army, though they are more spread out. If we raise our levies and mass them to attack then perhaps France can edge out a victory.

**2nd of December, 1067**

It seems the war is going ever poorly in the south. The French armies have been crushed and defeated by the Germans at every turn. As the chaos consumes the south it becomes apparent that King Philippe will turn 16 in a month, thus ending the regency. Most suspect my father-in-law Count Raoul of Amiens will be named Duke of Picardie for his efforts leading and commanding the armies during the war. If that is the case I will be made his vassal and lose my place on the Royal Council. Before I can let this happen I need to make a strike to carve out my own base of power. I’ve raised my levies and sent out letters to my allies the Dukes of Aquitaine and Burgundy to join me in a war against Duke Thibault of Champagne. Hopefully by right of conquest I can take a large section of his lands for myself. Of course waging such a war will certainly hurt my image across the Kingdom but it is necessary.

**30th of January, 1068**

In a move that surprised even me, King Philippe, now an adult and legally king by all rights, decided to name me Duke of Picarde. Though my Father-in-Law does own more land he was recently captured after another failed battle in Provence. Philippe seemed furious with him and blamed him for the disastrous war based on the letter I received. Adele seemed hurt by the scornful words the King had for her father. But I was not one to turn down such an honor. Of course my prestigious lineage certainly helped with the decision. Either way I now have to hope my allies will pull through for me and help secure this war. I suspect there will be a serious issue with Adeles brother once he becomes count. Likely he will try and take the Duchy for himself in a sort of rebellion in the future. But for now I can’t worry about potential future enemies.

**2nd of June, 1068**

I watched from a nearby hill in Guise as my army returned with almost 4000 more men lent from my allies. The banners of Burgundy and Aquitaine flew with mine as they braved the ford of the river and made their way across to attack the armies of Champagne. We pushed hard though I watched as our right flank completely fell apart and collapsed yet our men rushed through. Bodies and blood filled the riverbank. We outnumbered them two to one, and though we may have lost more men they were routed. Unfortunately as the battle cleared I saw what was a monsterous cloud up ahead. The German armies marched across and abushing us. There was nowhere to run.

**17th of July, 1068**

I tried to flee with my family and my army however the Germans were everywhere. They ravaged my army and my allies. They crushed our forces, burned several homes and buildings until finally they cornered me with my guards. I surrendered myself as long as they allowed my family to go. It seems I’ve now fallen victim to this war with the Germans.

**4th of August, 1068**

Seems the war is over, King Philippe has lost and Zeeland was handed over. Of course I am still rotting in a prison awaiting for my ransom to be paid. I’m sure Adele is scurrying to get her hands on the money. What’s more with me in here, it is up to my commanders to win the war against Champagne. At least I needn’t fear any more German intervention.

**27th of December, 1068**

Spending Christmas in a damp freezing cold German dungeon. I shivered against the bed before rolling over and vomiting on the floor. My throat burned and ached as I felt sweat dripping off of me despite the cold. I knew I’d fallen ill, of course the guards refused to listen to me as I begged for a bucket. How undignified.

**7th of June, 1069**

Nice, lovely, I find myself curling with the flu feeling miserable as I’m constantly entering coughing fits barely able to stomach what little slop they offer me. A young man entered as I could barely make out his voice. He was meek and thin “E-excuse me. Erm. *Darf ich mit dem Herzog sprechen? Ich habe wichtige erm da neuigkeiten von seiner familie.*” he began speaking in what even I could tell was broken german. The guards allowed him to pass. “What did you say?” I asked in a nasally voice “I heard something about family?” “Uh yes sire. Your wife Duchess Adele and your brother Regent Pierre sent me to inform you that the ransom should be paid in about 8 to 9 months.” I instantly turned to him as I strained my voice as best I could muster “8 to 9 months? What the hell is wrong with you!” “Now now my liege. Please I can tell you need to reserve your strength. I also come bearing good news. It seems your army's erm defeated the Duke of Champagne. You are now the Count of Brie and Baron of Provins. So there is that at least.” I tossed my head back against the wall “I suppose that is good news. Thank you messenger. Please allow my family to properly compensate you.” “Ah thank you my liege.” he said, giving a bow as he backed out of the prison cell.

**27th of June, 1069**

Seems my family came through for me after all. Not long after that messenger left I was given another message that my ransom had been paid. Thank the lord almighty. I mounted a carriage to wheel me back home to Vermandois so I can see my wife and son again. It’ll be nice to be back home after spending half a year locked away.

**1st of July, 1069**

Having only just returned I’m already being thrusted with news of what has happened since my absence. It seems the King just recently called to raise levies for another war. This time he is launching a war against the infidel rulers of Mallorca. I’ve heard the Iberians to the south have been waging thier wars defending their lands against the infidel muhammadens. By taking Mallorca we will break their hold on Mediterranean trade and be able to aid our fellow Christians in their holy war. I recall the tales my father would tell of our ancestor who led the Battle of Tours stopping the infidels from invading the Kingdom of the Franks. I certainly gave my approval for the war, may God bless King Philippe and France. It seems he is shaping up to be a great King after all.

**16th of July, 1069**

A messenger arrived in the court today bursting into the room to give me some announcement just as the physician was placing the organs of a still twitching frog corpse over my chest. She promised me that it would help cure me of the flu which I contracted in that German prison. I looked over to the door as they swung open “Duke Herberrrrt, erm.” “By the Lord's name boy, do you not know how to knock? What is it?” I asked despite my throat being still raw and sore from dry heaving earlier. “Yes, well,I come bearing a message from his majesty King Philippe, it seems he wishes to appoint you onto his advisory council as the Royal Marshal.” “during a time of war? Joyous me. Well I’m a tad busy at the moment.” “So should I tell his majesty that you have declined his offer?” “No no, I accept. Just that he'll have to accept that I won’t be at my best.” “As you wish” he gave a bow as he left the room. “Now on with the treatment Melisende”

**30th of July, 1069**

Today was a momentous occasion. The journey to Paris in my sickly disposition has not been enjoyable though I managed to arrive at his majesty's castle where his coronation ceremony took place. It was a small celebration as I met with the other advisors, and the ceremony was brief. The Bishop crowned him King of France as all joined in a polite applause.

**28th of February, 1070**

I’m finally starting to feel like myself again. Full strength, able to actively partake in governance and more importantly be able to uphold my family. Adele has been working to create a more secure spy network here to protect against any intrigue. I’ve made plenty of enemies after all. What’s more is Adele announced that she is pregnant with our child. It’s been 8 years since our daughter was born and honestly I’d forgotten the nerves of pregnancy. After all it is such a dangerous and vulnerable time for her.

**20th of March, 1070**

Seems that Englands been dragged into another war. Duke William of Normandy, who became King of England a little over 3 years ago, decided to declare a war against his rightful liege, King Philippe. Apparently William and Philippe disagreed over the management of the County of Vexin. My Father-in-Law, Raoul, was the rightful count but he is my vassal. Philippe agreed with me, yet William wants to bring his armies down to France anyways. Just because he was King of England he believes he can do as he pleases like a spoiled child.

**6th of September, 1070**

Today was the day. I rushed down as soon as I heard through the halls until I heard the screams. As I approached the door I stood outside impatiently for what felt like eternity before finally one of the midwives came out of the room after I had heard some crying from inside “Master, the Duchess is ready to let you in” as I came into the room there Adele laid holding our baby. As I approached I looked over running a finger along its cheek. “It is a girl.” I smiled “How does Marguerite sound?” “It sounds beautiful,” Adele replied “Marguerite.”

**23rd of April, 1072**

“I take back every kind word I’d given about that boy, he is a coward!” I shouted “Sire…” the messenger meekly spoke up “We are talking about our King.” “Yes yes, a cowardly King too incapable of fending off a few dozen infidels on some islands, and a King who thinks his glory beyond our borders is worth more than his own people!” “Yes sire…” he agreed quietly “I mean, those English bastards just ravaged my countryside, attacked my people! He is supposed to protect me and my lands, yet he prances about never putting up a fight and surrenders MY land to that Norman barbarian?!” “I have no idea why he’d do such a thing, sire…” “Paris is burning as Mahomedans ravage the land, pillaging and raping French subjects. Coward! Coward I say!” “Well sire why didn’t you raise your levies to..” I turned to him and my glare must have made him fear the face of god as I’d never seen a grown man gulp and shiver like that. I approached slowly holding out my finger as I explained the simplicity of this premise to him “At best I can muster maybe what? Two thousand men? More likely less. The English have five! It’d be a slaughter! No. William is his subject, England is a foreign crown. It is the Kings job to protect his lands and his people from foreign enemies. But clearly he cannot even do that.” I shook my head trembling in anger. “Anyways, I’m sorry. What did you come in here for?” The servant was still trembling though he was more afraid, maybe thought I was to order his hanging at any moment. “Er would you like pressed duck or roasted pork tonight sire…” “Oh I’ll have roasted pork if you would.” “Right away sire..” he said as he scrambled out of the room.

**28th of June, 1072**

After weeks of fever and general fatigue my court physician has diagnosed me with having the Great Pox. Wherever I contracted such a filth I’ve no idea though these lesions that have formed strike fear right into my soul. She’s recommended a treatment of bloodletting to help my humors balance. “This disease will plague you for the rest of your life. Though by balancing your humors we can perhaps make the symptoms more tolerable.” “Do as you must”.

**11th of May, 1073**

I swear I saw them, the shadows speaking to me. I am starting to hear voices. I think that my castle is haunted. I remember hearing a tale about an old lord in this castle who fell down the stairs running after his grandchildren. I remember now, it was a raspy voice, hollow inside. No what am I saying, there is no such thing as spirits. It must be the whispers of my enemies, plotting to blow me into the sky with manure or conjuring a comet to strike my bed in my sleep. I’ll show them. I’ll see their plots a league ahead of time. Leagues are a measure of distance not time. Silly me.

**6th of August, 1073**

I was hiding in the bedroom, I didn’t want to be seen. That's when I saw her sleeping there, oh my sweet Adele. As I approached though I saw it. The shadows had gotten to her. She was in the bed blood pooled in her pillow and around her lips. She was so pale, so cold. I wanted to be closer with her. I kissed her blood soaked lips, they were so cold. “I’m sorry my sweet Adele. I didn’t protect you. The shadows caught you. My dear, my love.” I could barely make it all out as my tears dripped onto her flesh. To be taken so young.

**15th of April, 1074**

Some Occitan named Gui has gathered up an army down south. Has quite a bit of support from the local populations. Wants to ‘liberate’ the Kingdom of Aquitaine. Such chaos, I bet King Philippe will fail in defeating this uprising. If France loses Aquitaine, the Kingdom will fall apart. I miss Adele. I wish I lived in brighter days. King Philippe has brought his armies back from Mallorca but the war isn’t over. France is so weak and divided. Truly this is the end of a great people. 

 

**10th of February, 1075**

I was told by my brother that I should remarry. I can’t ‘be upset and hung up on it forever’. Apparently producing more children is of the utmost importance to the realm. He found this Iberian woman, a daughter of a count I think he said. Her name was Dordia and her family was wealthy enough they offered a dowry to help pay for several new buildings and guild halls in Guise. I couldn’t refuse, and I mean it. Today she arrived and we had our wedding. She was beautiful, a bit promiscuous throughout our meeting. I don’t dislike her, though I can’t help but miss my Adele. 

&#x200B;

**9th of January, 1076**

My boy Eudes is really growing up. Today is the day of his wedding to Aines de Poitou, the daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine. An important alliance to be sure, her father is probably the single most powerful man in France aside from the King. The ceremony was beautiful as I sat next to my wife Dordia, who was showing her belly from pregnancy. I wish Adele could have been here to see our son wed his wife. But alas, this is how it is. I feel more alone now than ever.

**22nd of May, 1076**

It’s been easier to throw myself into my work. King Philippe appointed me as his new Chancellor. After Adele's death I resigned as his Royal Marshal but now I am ready for court work and politics. Though it seems Philippe has earned the ire of many others. His failures with Mallorca and the growing rebellion in Aquitaine has left most French nobility dissatisfied with the King. He’s even managed to offend his holiness, Pope Alexander II who excommunicated King Philippe a few years ago. I returned today to Vermandois as Dordia should be giving birth any time now. Though when I arrived I found a letter had arrived a few days prior bearing the Papal Seal. As I sat in my study opening the letter reading it over I realized it was directly signed by Pope Alexander II himself. In it he spoke of the sinfulness of King Philippe and his failures in fighting the Muslims and defending his lands. He specifically recounted my lineage “You are the sole male heir of Charlemagne, as such you are the rightful King of France.” he gave me his blessing and promised to back my ‘divine right’ to rule this Kingdom. I collapsed into my seat, this was an important decision. Do I betray Philippe? Conspire with the French nobility to overthrow him? If I have the Popes backing my right is just. Of course should I fail, then this will horribly backfire. I will accept the Popes offer though I will keep this secret. I will draft him a letter accepting his offer and go from there. Perhaps I should resign as his chancellor?

**24th of June, 1076**

I’ve officially resigned as Chancellor and begun gathering support among the French nobility for my claim to the throne. I need some major funds if I want to be able to support a war but luckily these failed wars of Philippes have worn his army down. Today though, no more plots, no more politics, only joy as I entered the room to see Dordia holding my second son. We named him Louis as I held my son. Eudes would now have a younger brother. Seeing this son only cemented my resolve. I want to give him a good inheritance, this throne is not just for me but for my sons, my heirs.

**2nd of August, 1076**

My resolve has been steeled, I have arranged marriages and alliances with both the Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich IV and King Sancho II of Castille. With the Pope granting me divine right, their political support, plus the support of what nobility are willing to back me I am ready to draft my ultimatum. Unfortunately, multiple other members of the French nobility have decided to put their own candidates for the throne. Philippe has become universally despised, his being deposed is only a matter of when not if. I sat at my desk and wrote the ultimatum. *“My Liege, King Philippe Capet of France, With the blessings of Pope Alexander II, the support of the most powerful lords of Europe, and even your own nobility I humbly request your abdication. King Philippe, I have been your most loyal and obedient servant for many years. When all others lost their faith or had their doubts I had been a staunch defender. I know you think highly of me, not just for my lineage but for the care I have for this Kingdom and your subjects. This is not of ill will towards you but for the future of the French Kingdom. If you remain, others will violently depose you or worse make attempts on your life. You have many enemies, and I wish to remain your ally and friend. Abdicate, resign the throne to me by the grace of God. And should you do so honorably, allow a peaceful transfer of power then perhaps this Kingdom can return to a track of progress and prosperity. Your Obedient Servant, Herbert Karling”* And with that I hand the scroll with my seal to the messenger and send him to Paris. At the same time I raise my levies, ready for war. Even if he surrenders which I doubt, I will need to be ready to fight these wars Philippe has begun.

**8th of August, 1076**

When the messenger arrived I was overseeing a military camp as my levies gathered. I already knew the response before I undid the seal. *“Dear Duke Herbert Karling of Picarde, I am insulted and betrayed. When I was surrounded by enemies you were the one I relied on. I made you what you are. You cling to your* ***lineage*** *so much yet you’ve never earned a thing for yourself. I made you Duke, I made you Marshal and I allowed you to resign when your wife had passed, God rest her soul. When you asked to return I made you Chancellor because I trusted you. You were the only one I could trust. Clearly I am  a failure as a King as you said. For I had sourly misjudged your character. I will not make that error again. You will never be King. The Rightful King of France, Philippe Capet.”* War it is. I will send word to King Sancho II to join me. 

&#x200B;

**7th of December, 1076**

My armies have gathered and we march southwest to hopefully meet with the Castillians. I am aware that King Philippe and the majority of his forces were located int he same direction, I wouldn’t be surprised if they enter battle before we even get there. Hopefully the greater Castillian army can overwhelm Philippe and force him into a retreat. The boy is a capable warrior and commander, he is just a terrible strategist. Once he is on his back heel he won’t know what to do, then I will be able to play with him like a cat with a mouse just before devouring him.

**26th of January, 1077**

We encountered the French army in Bassac with their allies of Barcelona. Seems Philippe abandoned what was left of his forces. A messenger from Sancho informed me that they had killed somewhere over a thousand of his men, another 100 died as we crashed down on them. They are battered and weak. We will leave them and march north to Paris. Once the capital is mine, it won’t take much more to assert my right as King.

**3rd of August, 1077**

I was sitting in my tent receiving treatment for my Great Pox. Melisende was applying leeches when one of my commanders, Jaufre, entered “My liege, the city of Paris has fallen.” I smiled as another leech attached to my forearm. “Excellent. Get the men ready to pack up and move on. Leave a small garrison. We will have the entire county in our grip by the end of the year. Once the County is ours, France will fall. Pope Alexander was right, I truly do have Gods blessing.” I smiled laying back down as the leeches were now applied to my cheeks and forehead. 

&#x200B;

**12th of December, 1078**

Philippe is stubborn, that is what I have learned. All of Paris and Senlis have fallen, I march to Orleans and yet he refuses to surrender. What's more it seems my rebellion has finally convinced him to end his foolish war with Mallorca and he even managed to put down the revolt in Aquitaine. Who knew all it took was a civil war for Philippe to become a competent King. Either way I am grateful to him, whether I win this war or not, Aquitaine will remain firmly within France. Duke Ramon-Bereguer of Barcelona has raised an army of 2000 men to try and help his ally remain in power. My scouts have come to me saying that he is taking his army to Sens. We can get to him first, and crush his forces. Any shred of hope Philippe has must be sliced apart.

**18th of January, 1079**

We’ve chased the Catalans to Cosne where we’ve engaged with them. My scouts underestimated their size, they easily reached somewhere around 3000 men. Nonetheless, my commanders are skilled men of great renown. I have full faith in their abilities and in the Castilian forces alongside us.

**9th of December, 1079**

The siege of Orleans was over, as we traveled north to Paris we met the last of the French forces as we crushed them in Sens Philippe was brought to the camp hands bound. It was now that he knew the war was over. His ally has abandoned him, God has chosen his victor. “You are a filthy traitor.” Philippe cursed to me as I sighed “When you were still a boy, I had so much hope in you. You were like a second son to me Philippe. But you’ve failed time and time again. It’s time son.” “Don’t call me son” “It’s time for you to abdicate, it’s what is best for you and for this Kingdom.” He looked disgusted with me “You shouldn’t pretend like this is for the Kingdom, or for me. You’re a traitor, hungry for power and you only care about yourself. Usurper, that’s how they will remember you.” I took off Philippes crown and nodded “Well let’s see what the people in Paris have to say.”

dh3zro,How do I get Sicily if I started in 1066?,"I started as Matilda in Tuscany, and now I'm playing as her son. the Byzantines somehow took over Apulia, and now I'm stuck. I'm getting too large to stay King of Italy, and need to get an Emperor title, because I'm starting to approach my vassal limit. But, I can only get about 10k troops, to Byzantium's 23k. I waited until I had 650 gold, and Byzantium was at war with the Seljuks, and they still just sent everything they had at me, even though i could clearly see the Turks were literally at the gates of Constantinople, but they still decided to just send their massive death stack at me.  I put about 16k troops at the strait, but if I beat back one stack the ai just sends another 20k, and inevitably I run out of money, and lose my mercs. Is it worth getting independence from the HRE and swearing fealty to them, just for this one stupid duchy? Or do i just need more money? Is this normal? It seems pretty rare to me that Byzantium is able to secure Southern Italy faster than I could conquer all of the Kingdom of Italy. I don't really want to swear fealty, because if I do, all Byzantium has to do to form Rome is take out the Papacy, and Venice, because I own everything else, and I don't want to have to fight a neo Roman Empire just to be able to form Italia.

**14 September 1066**

I enter [the Black Chamber](http://www.kcn.ru/tat_en/history/images/oldtower.jpg), the legislature of my people, dragging my predecessor behind me in chains. Dirt, grime, and pebbles from the ground outside have lodged themselves in his wounds. On either side of me march proudly the courtiers and noblemen who plotted to install me in my rightful place.

The chamber floor is square, with rows of benches on either side of the throne. Afternoon sunlight streams through the stained glass windows of the dome and sparkles on the abstract mosaics along the chamber walls. My chained captive leaves a wide smear of blood and tears on the well-polished floor as I drag him behind me. The assemblymen murmur among themselves, their eyes falling on their she-dog of a former ruler. I speak.

""Assemblymen, welcome. I have patiently awaited this day. You will see that many seats within this chamber sit empty; your brethren who resisted my rise to power are dead. Their lands are confiscated, their older sons are executed, and their widows, daughters, and younger sons will bring much pleasure to me and my men before they, too, are killed.

""Although I will not tolerate treason during my reign, I will endeavor to be a just and honest monarch. And so long as you obey my commands, I will content myself with cruelty against our enemies. Give me your loyalty and I will build up a fortune for the Bulgarians of the Volga not seen since our ancestors swept across the steppe with the armies of Attila.""

The assemblymen are gazing at their feet. Their expressions are far away. One by one, their eyes turn to look upon me. Shaking his head at their timidity, my newly-appointed steward, Mayor Uzluk of Suar, rises from his seat and claps loudly. Like deer bolting from a copse, the rest of the assembly rises in imitation. Some feign joyful weeping; others give forced cheers and praises.

I am [Ishanadl, Duke of the Bulgars of the Volga](http://i.imgur.com/0J1E1Ve.jpg). Beware.

***

[**15 September 1066**](http://i.imgur.com/pQ2Kfx1h.jpg)

A messenger arrives from the court of Biyar, [High Chief of the Mordvins](http://i.imgur.com/Wqc9fCX.jpg).

""Your highness, sovereign Duke of the Volga Bulgarians, lately sending couriers into our land, the Cheremisa, did claim certain villages and strongholds, in right of your great predecessor, Attila the Hun. In answer of which claim, the High Chief my master says that you savour too much of your youth, and bids you satisfy yourself with the shores of the confluence of the Volga, as befits your contented nature. He therefore sends you, as more appropriate for your youthful spirit, this chest of mighty treasure; and in lieu of this, desires to hear no more of you. This the High Chief speaks.""

I gesture to my stewards, Mayor Uzluk, to examine the contents of the small chest borne by the messenger.

""What treasure, steward?""

Uzluk peers into the chest, frowning. He appears hesitant.

""...ankle bone dice, my liege, [with which to play Asik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shagai).""

I drum my fingers against the arm of my throne. My head tilts back, and I gaze at the domed roof above me in contemplation. The assembly sits silent, their eyes fixed on me or on the tremulous messenger. At last, I speak.

""We are glad that your High Chief is so pleasant with us. We thank you for his present. And when we have roused our retainers, we will, in the Cheremisa, by God's grace, play a game with him. Tell your master that I will crush him; I will see him and his people driven before me; and I will listen with delight to the lamentation of his women. Go in peace, and tell him. Go!""

As the messenger departs, I summon my riders into the chamber. Scribes hurriedly pen my shouted orders.

""Call up the troops! I want two thousand men assembled in Bulgar by the end of the month!""

***

**17 December, 1066 - 14 January 1067**

The godless horde of High Chief Biyar surround [the walls of Bulgar](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Bolgar.JPG) in a foolhardy siege. Hearing the roar of our hooves, the Suomenusko devils flee to [the fields of Ashli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aşlı), where we overtake them. I myself lead the vanguard and delight in the slaughter of over a thousand worthless pagans. Routed, Biyar and his personal guard flee back to the safety of the Mordvin patrimony. The Battle of Ashli is a great victory; that we outnumbered our foe two to one is of no consequence.

***

**17 January 1067**

As we march west into the heart of Mordvin territory we are intercepted by a courier from the capital. I am informed that Pyera, [High Chief of Perm](http://i.imgur.com/mdBcVRs.jpg), has invaded the northern reaches of our patrimony to press his claim to the valley of Votyaki. [The Mordvins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordvins) are weak and spineless; the armies of Perm are not. I must force a northward march to deal with Pyera before returning south to complete my conquest of the Cheremisa.

***

**26 April - 5 August 1067**

Our forces clash with High Chief Pyera at the Battle of Sarana in Votyaki. Our forces are evenly mached, with no more than fifteen hundred men to a side. Although there is no great slaughter, the battle is a tactical victory. We pursue Pyera's host east to the very gates of [Perym, their capital](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Sergei_Mikhailovich_Prokudin-Gorskii_-_City_of_Perm._General_view_%281910%29.jpg)! Pyera's troops are driven against their walls and impaled. Alas, Pyera and his personal retainers escaped through a secret tunnel back into the city. Rather than lay siege to the pagan citadel, I lead my troops south to complete our destruction of the Mordvins.

***

**26 October 1067**

My men toast to my health as news reaches the camp that my First Wife, Ipekel, has given birth to a son! My dutiful wife has named him Ishanadl in my honour. Some day, God willing, all that I rule now will belong to him and his heirs in perpetuity.

***

**6 November 1070**

Victory! I lay waste to the Mordvins and delight in the personal torture and execution of their priests and noblemen. Biyar, his wife and two daughters in tow, flees to Perym. I later learn that my other foe, Pyera, takes them into his care at Perym. I divide the Cheremisa among various courtiers - contented, quiet stewards who will obey me for the foreseeable future - and return to Bulgar in triumph.

***

[**20 December 1070 - 19 September 1071**](http://i.imgur.com/rdq6Ngjh.jpg)

[Chief Tugan of Kerzhenets](http://i.imgur.com/KgOdzUz.jpg), one of my few pagan vassals, is scandalized by my treatment of the Mordvins. He demands I grant him independence! The fool! My harsh treatment is justified. They're barely human!

My forces were ready to depart Bulgar for Perym anyway. At the Battle of Zäy we crush Tugan's forces and [sack his citadel at Qazan](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Kazan_cityscape.jpg). My troops lay siege to the fortified villages and temples that surround the citadel, looting and raping as they go.

***

**13 November 1071**

A courier arrives from Bulgar with more troubling news: Begluk, [the High Chief of Tyumen](http://i.imgur.com/7v4v5fT.jpg) - a vassal of the Khan of Cumania - has invaded our patrimony over his claim to one of our counties! I order a small detachment to march north to continue the fight against the pagans of Perm, headed by my faithful steward, Uzluk, while the bulk of my forces prepares to march south to meet the Tyumen host.

***

**7 March 1072**

I find Chief Tugan, the snivelling lord of Kerzhenets, hiding in the cellar of a freshly-sacked temple. His wife and two sons cower there beside him. After a tumble with his wife, and another with one of his sons (I can't remember which, really), I cut off his thumbs and throw him in prison. He'll stay there till he rots, no matter how many times he begs for more suitable accomodations! I strip him of his title and grant it to one of my loyal followers.

As I bathe at camp that evening, news reaches me regarding the Khan of Cumania and his vassals, the High Chiefs of Tyumen and Aktobe. Apparently [the two of them have freed themselves from the Khan's yoke](http://i.imgur.com/UnkELEY.jpg) and now rule as independent lords. Willfully cut off from the assistance of his former Khan, the High Chief of Tyumen may be easier to repel than I had first assumed...

***

**8 - 21 January 1073**

The Battle of Belebey is as brief as it is decisive. Don't these idiot nomads know how to fight? My forces, numbering over twenty-four hundred, caught a mere one thousand troops drunk on wine after sacking one of my vassal's holdings. They were an easy target and died quickly.

***

**25 December 1073**

Word reaches me that my steward, Uzyuk, has successfully sacked the capital city of Perym in the lands of Perm. Surrounded by my soldiers with no avenue of escape, High Chief Pyera has accepted defeat. He will not press his claim further. Uzyuk's men in Perm march south to join the bulk of my forces as we sack the Cuman villages, temples, and citadels of Tyumen.

***

**13 September 1074**

[Tyumen has fallen](http://i.imgur.com/Z9mrWAI.jpg)! My troops have taken hold of the city. After the populace has been subdued and the city walls garrisoned with men under my command, I take it upon myself to inspect the tallest building in the city.

While peering out of one of the tower's windows, what should I see but the face of my own son and heir, Ishanadl, peeking back at me! The boy, who has accompanied me with his mother on my campaign in Tyumen, is about six years old now; it's high time I took him under my wing and educated him! Fatherly discipline will keep him from wandering off so foolishly. I seize him by the waist, pull him inside, and drop him on the floor of the tower.

""Ishanadl! What are you doing?""

""Exploring the walls, father. I'm curious about how they're made. They look very different from the walls we have in Bulgar.""

""Oh, very well. If you can't be cautious, at least be smart about where you go wandering.""

""Curiosity never killed anyone, father!""

""True. Go on, now. Be quick about it.""

What a brave little boy.

Makedon play through. End Schism. Reform Rome. The Karlings left a shit-pile of bordergore behind them and the umayyads have moved into Aquitaine. North of there is just more barbarian chaos.

So I'm chilling, watching my threat tick down and debating whether to secure Egypt, Tripolitania, or Provence from the kebab next when I get the warning that Temujib has arrived with 100k of screaming attrition-less steppe monsters. I keep an eye on his progress. Soon he has Mongolia, then Cumania. I'm not worried because I have 75k in levies plus 35k gold, I can match him. And my heir is a solid warrior, like me.

Then he dies. Cancer. Then I die. Being old. Now I'm a Lazy Spender named Theophylactos with 6 martial. Did I mention my Council is full of Exarchs?

So there goes 10k troops. And here comes another Jihad for Jerusalem. It's just a Shia jihad, which means a bunch of bumpkins from Abbysinia and Yemen, so I don't even bother raising my demesne troops to deal  with it. Vassals only. But I'm not about to send my guys down to the Horn of Africa while Jochi is horse-raping Cumania and Georgia. So It takes forever for the Warscore to tick up. But I'm getting ready, doing the war focus, learning Unyielding and Rough Terrain.

Maybe two months after the Caliph sends his peace-gold, Jochi comes at me for Armenia. By the time I get my troops gathered, he's sieged down three counties and I'm at -56%. And I'm keeping stacks separated so as to avoid attrition.

Which actually works in my favor, because it makes Jochi send his 50k stack against my 41k stack while I've got more troops a county over. Yeah, those frozen ponies don't do so good in the mountains of Cilicia, do they, Hun? WHERE IS YOUR SKY LORD NOW?

After that, the tempo is mine. I siege my stuff back, wreck him two or so more times, and Temujin's son is back at the ass end of the map fighting Sunnia and Zoro revolts with less than half of his former strength and no way to get it back. Triumph time.

I don't know how common my experience is. But with all the ""Mongols took Byzantium in one war"" posts I've seen, I thought I'd share it anyway.

My father past away, leaving the realm in chaos and disarray.  
Many jackals and vultures have risen, who previously called themsleves my father's loyal vassal, but now lay claim to his titles.  
The foreigners from Pisa, seeing the chaos in our realm, send a peace offer for us to surrender, my regent and mother, the craven she is, immediately accepts.  
There is not much I can do at my current age to keep our realm together.  

***
[7 june 1229](http://i.imgur.com/rCJNiHD.jpg)  

My father left me with a sizeable sum of money.  
My mother thought it wise to spend it on barbarians from nubia to assist is in this war.  
Alas their upkeep would prove to be too much to maintain for more than a year.

I spent today with my mother as she was meeing with the generals.
Observing the situation they realized they had to surrnder one war to win the other.  
After close observation, they decide to concede the Kingdom of Mesopotamia, a small part of my realm to a distant relative, the traitorous bastard.  

***
[18 may 1230](http://i.imgur.com/1fePMQi.jpg)

It was done. 
I am no longer the king of mesoptamia, lose on kingdom to save the other.  
My distant relative now calls himslef King-Bishop Henry IV of Mesopotamia, I'm sure he won't reign long.  
Now it's time to focus on the last remaining rebellion and restore order.

He seems to be calling ME as his faithful ally!  
Naturally, my mother considered it unwise to heed his call, and we gracefully refused.

Just when we nearly finished with our wars, more vultures appear from the ashes.  
It appears they want the pretender, King Henry IV, on my rightful throne of syria.  
It seems our realm won't get to rest from the war after all.

My fourth nameday came and went.  
The realm is still in disarray, and I begin to wonder if my mother is a good regent.  
My first three years have been tumultuous, my father, may he rest in peace, did not leave me in an easy situation.  
He handed out many titles to members of the church, and decided it wise to tax them heavily.  
I almost don't blame them for rebelling, but such insolance must not be tolerated.

My mother came to me today, the look of worry on her face.  
It seems my traiterous uncle is planning to murder me, and she insists I must be kept with a group of guards all day.  
I'm not allowed to go outside and play anymore.  
I don't like war.

[7 september 1232](http://i.imgur.com/Cqt2kCX.jpg)  

A messenger arived at court today.  
He immediately wanted to speak to mother.  
I listened in on the conversation and learned of shocking news.  
It appears that the barbarian mongol hordes to the east declare war upon us, no doubt to take advantage of our weakened state.  
They intend to take all the lands in the kingdom of mesopotamia, and no doubt burn their cities to the ground.  

***
[18 march 1233](http://i.imgur.com/pBzp5Wf.jpg)  

The mongols have arrive, and started their invasion in Tigris.  
They make short work of the relatively small garrison stationed there, and being looting and raping our subjects.  
Dirty barbarians.  

***
[27 july 1233](http://i.imgur.com/VJiBUSV.jpg)  

It was clear we stood no chance against the barbarian horde, so my mother wisely sued them for peace.  
We now lost control of any lands in the Kingdom of Mesopotamia, but better to lose one kingdom than lose everything.  
We'll come back for those barbarians when they least expect it.  

***
[29 may 1234](http://i.imgur.com/v1GulXI.jpg)  

A messenger of the rebels arrived today.  
I listened in on his conversation with mother.  
It seems their leader has come to his senses and wants to give up his foolish rebellion and recognize my rightful reign in Syria.  
Just one more rebel to take care off, it won't be long till we can breave a sigh of peace.  

***
[28 june 1234](http://i.imgur.com/Y7eWxfv.jpg)  

The traitor was brought before my mother today.  
He claims that, as a man of god, she has no right to imprison him.  
Naturally my mother disputed his foolish claims, and threw him back in the dungeon, lest he rebels again.

***
[4 december 1234](http://i.imgur.com/KXeRntB.jpg)  

I haven't been feeling well lately.  
The court doctor arrived and told me I should rest and I'm not allowed to leave the bed to go and play.  
Mother has been at my bedside for the last few hours, she doesn't want to show me, but I can see she looks worried.  

***
[19 march 1235](http://i.imgur.com/xUrM1Sc.jpg)  

I'm feeling much better again, and I'm allowed to go outside again!  
It would have been dreadful if I didn't recover from this illness, with the state our realm is currently in.  
I trust that mother will unite the realm soon.  

***
[4 may 1235](http://i.imgur.com/7DhQKw2.jpg)  

We recieved word that the barbarian hordes have looted and burned Baghdad.  
This is the capital of the pretender, Henry IV of Mesopotamia.  
Serves him right for doubting my divine rule.

Finally, after 6 years of non stop fighting, the realm is at peace.  
When mother took my into the village, I could see the happy faces on the peasants, who are obviously pleased they can safely work their fields again.  
Now let's hope this peace lasts, for I fear my vassals still do not appreciate my rule.

Now that the war is over, mother found it time for me to begin my education.  
She send me to the court of Osbern, the duke of Syria, to be trained as a proper ruler.  
I didn't like it, as this meant I wouldn't have as much time to play outside.  

***
[27 august 1235](http://i.imgur.com/iBTOivg.jpg)  

My mother couldn't even miss for a month.  
She sent word for me to return back to court.  
A elderly women had arrived, and she would now be assigend as my new guardian.  
I wished mother would educate me, but she is probably too busy ruling my realm.

[My guardian walked in](http://i.imgur.com/2cSkvhT.jpg) on me reading the bible, and she swiftly took it away, encouraging me to go play outside.  
I don't understand why I was not allowed to read God's word.  

***
[19 may 1236](http://i.imgur.com/TghzPvg.jpg)  

My mother told me our realm would be at war again.  
Seeing the state of the heathen kingdom nearby, she wisely decided to declare war on their ""Caliph"" for lands that are rightfully ours.  
Let's hope fortune is on our side and the war will end swiftly.

We tried to negotiate a treaty with the barbarian hordes to the East.  
We anxiously awaited his return, hoping for a peaceful coexistance.  
The only thing that returned of our message was his disembodied head.  
Mother quickly send me away, but I had already become sick at the sight of the head and emptied my stomach's contents.  
It seems the barbarians have declared war on us, for an invasion of Syria.  
My mother holds me tightly, for we might not be long for this world.

I asked mother for some new playthings today, but she said we don't have the money to afford it.  
This isn't fair, I'm a king, yet the peasents from the village have better toys then I do.  
I envy them, why do they have more than their king?

Seeing the unhalted conquest of our neighbours at the hands of the mongols, my mother decided to send tribute to the young khan.  
Let us hope that he'll be inclined to not attack us, lest the lackluster tribute might anger him.

Some of our neighbours have beens stranded without a liege.  
Mother contacted them asking them to join as, so we can unite against the mongol threat, whatever good it will do.  
One of the counts accepted, whilst the other brazenly refuses.  
The loyal count was swiftly awarded the title ""Cupbearer"" for his loyal service.

The pope called for a crusade to expel the heathens from Sicily.  
Why he would not call a crusade to return my rightful kingdom, Syria, is unbeknownst to me.  
Althouogh we are not in a position to help, we will offer our aid to please the pope.  
We wouldn't gain any lands after all, since the title King of Sicily is already taken by a pious christian.  
It seems the heretical behaviour of the Doge of Pisa does not rest well with the pope.

Seeing one of our kinsman being invade by heathens angered my mother, and she told me we had to honor our blood ties.  
We send word that our armies would be marching to join their war, and relief them from the heathen opression.

My 16th birthday has arrive, but it is no celebration.  
The air is filled with the musty smell of the burnign cities of the neighbouring Byzantine Empire.  
It seems even the mighty basileus couldn't stop the advance of the horde.  
My education did not make a excellent ruler out of me, probably due to all the war time interruptions.  
I can't wait to lead my kingdom back to glory again and take away the titles that the filthy barbarians took, but for now I must bide my time.  

With coming of age comes the promise of marriage, so that I may sire many heirs.  
Choosing a good wife is vital to a good rule.  
I recieved a later from the [Basilissa of the Byzantine Empire](http://i.imgur.com/mZ9pz2i.jpg), offering a betrothal.  
Naturally I accepted, I can't wait to take the Empire from her hands.

[**27th February 1203:**](http://min.us/llZEGFi9nuwuq)

Yesterday, I got news that my father is dead. I never really had a great relationship with my father, but...I'm deeply saddened by his loss, and I don't know what I will do. I now have command of the biggest empire in Europe, and I feel like a mouse surrounded by lions. I ordered my fathers will read out, in which he proclaimed all his lands and titles handed to me, along with...something odd. He proclaimed he also wanted a book handed down to me. It was brought from my fathers chambers to me as I ate with my wives. At first I discounted it, but later on in the night I could not sleep. Eventually I decided to read it, and it turns out that my father, and his father before him and so on, kept a diary of his life, so that the story of House Abdeddit may survive the tests of time.

I sat up all night reading it, and I have decided to follow the tradition. In hundreds of years, when my descendant sits upon the throne of the Empire of Europe, historians will look back on these diaries to teach the children about the rise of House Abdeddit. My first order of business, is to send couriers to every corner of the lands, to spread word to my vassals that I have succeeded the throne.

I have also decided to continue my fathers war for Mangyshlak, but I have stood down some of the levies coming from the northern parts of my empire. I do this because it would take too long for the levies to reach the battleground, and we already outnumber their forces seven to one.

[**13th March 1203:**](http://min.us/l20jEgdtAqbLC)

Today, I called my first council meeting. They walked in single file, one by one, all visibly tired and exhausted. I had put them to work immediately, trying to keep stability in the realm. They had been working harder than ever, so imagine their surprise when I replaced them all. I...Didn't feel good about it. But I need strong advisers if I am to keep this empire. It would not take much for the heathens to invade us at this point. I gathered the best of the best from all over the lands for my council, and I even made a new friend. My feel my Marshall, Bay Aepak, is completely loyal to me. With all other new councillors, I could feel the deceit in their eyes, and it scares me. Bay Aepak, however, is either a deceitful snake or truly a friend to be trusted. I will go with the latter, I need some reassurance in these troubled times.

[**28th April 1203:**](http://min.us/lbwJCZDniogfS7)

I just got word that the 2000 men who were raised in Embra, did not get out of the province fast enough to escape the Khwarzim army. I am disgusted and infuriated at this. Over 1000 of our men were slaughtered, how could my Marshall make such a novice mistake? I was about to let it at him but... the way he looked at me. In his eyes I could see a mixture of remorse and power that scared me. I averted my eyes almost immediately. I regret it now, how am I supposed to show my power if I cannot even look my friends and vassals in the eye?

[**8th May 1203:**](http://min.us/lbxJDSCgGuO087)

 The horde has been assembled, and is marching to meet the Khwarzim army in open battle. We have eight times their number, and some of the best commanders in charge of the army! With sound advice from my Marshall, I have placed Kilic, Itak and the Marshall himself in charge of the army, split up with 5000 troops each. The Khwarzims are going to regret not peacefully giving his lands to the rightful ruler. I just wish I didn't have to have to go to war. But, sins of the father and all that. Also, it shows I am a strong ruler... Something I'm not. I don't like the needless killing over tracts of land, but it is the way of Allah and life, and so it shall be.

[**28th May 1203:**](http://min.us/lbjz4vu6LaWQP9)

Allahu Akbar! God has seen fit to grant me a beautiful baby daughter, (though I would have liked to have a son) truly Allah is merciful. I have named her Usunbike, after my beautiful wife (even though she did not birth her.) I know that the girl will grow up to be beautiful.

[**31st May 1203:**](http://min.us/liyhpTmmRt18G)

After some pondering, I have decided to grant the Beylik of Saray to my trusted friend and adviser, Aepak. I have done so not only as a gift, but as my total holdings are too big for my steward to properly administer. There is also growing discontent among my vassals about my number of holdings. I do not wish for a rebellion, so I'm going to lessen my holdings over the next couple of months.

[**1st June 1203:**](http://min.us/lKcA6dKOAX6qd)

Over the previous days, my spymaster has been feeding me rumours, about my brother plotting against my rule. At first I thought they were lies, fed to me to breed dissent. But, later my spymaster came back to me, this time with damning evidence about my brothers treason. He urged me to send for my brothers arrest immediately, but I held off on it. I wanted to confront him first, maybe there was some mistake? I went to my brothers chambers to accuse him and to my horror, he did not even flinch in admitting it! He said I was a craven usurper, and that I did not deserve to rule! I was taken aback, afraid, and I tried to reason with my brother. I asked him to reconsider his actions, but he would have none of it. He says he and other dukes were planning to rebel. I'm shocked that he would outright admit it... Quite frankly I'm disgusted. I've had him arrested and thrown in the dungeons, and he is to stay there.

[**6th June 1203:**](http://min.us/l5L13SKPS8MKS) 

I've got great news indeed! My Marshall tells me that we have crushed their armies with minimal loss to ours. Allahu Akbar!

[**14th June 1203:**](http://min.us/lejYkYkXrF9Ky) Today I got word that one of my courtiers has murdered themselves! I would not call myself a zealot, but any servant of Allah that would do such a thing disgusts me! But... I can not help but feel myself feeling pity for the soul that would prefer eternal damnation rather than live their life. Against my Court Imams wishes, I have not desecrated her name. But I will not pay for her funeral.

[**14th July 1203:**](http://min.us/lbsb6z5jsED3ku) 

I just got word from my Marshall after my last entry, that the army of Khwarzim has been completely destroyed! Again, I cannot help but feel pity for the soldiers' lives that have been lost, those who had no choice in whether they fought. I guess I am in a pitiful state today. Perhaps this is why people openly plot against me, I'm too kind! I must teach them to fear my wrath.

[**12th August 1203:**](http://min.us/lbuUsS8Jpgvm0v) 

I was told today by my Court Imam that the Nestorian heresy has appeared in the province of Murom! I was playing with my children, teaching them games when I was asked to see Timariot. I dispatched him to the province at once, but I asked him to try and crush the heresy with as little casualties as possible. He seemed taken aback, but agreed. As he was walking out, I heard him sniggering at me, but I did not do anything. I'm a pathetic ruler.

[**9th September 1203:**](http://min.us/lqfdfddDw1ss7) 

Words cannot describe the terror I am feeling right now. I was in my office, writing letters, when I hear screaming and gurgling. I jumped up from my chair, terrified, and opened the door. I asked my guard to go see what the commotion was. He ran off, only to come back with my spymaster covered in blood. I screamed as he collapsed in front of me, coughing blood while extra spilt out of his torso. The blood was a dark crimson and I nearly fainted at the sight of it. He kept crawling towards me as I edged backwards, but he managed to whisper one thing. One, terrible name. “Hashshashin.” I have guards searching the entire castle, but the killer has not been found. I have tripled my guard and I'm taking extra precautions to not be alone ever. I have scheduled Court Imam to have 1000 prayers sent to Allah in my name. Allah is merciful.

[**12th September 1203:**](http://min.us/lFIVVninAQFwO) 

Today I have a new spymaster. His name is Kotyan of Tver, and I am told he is good at his job. I damn well hope so, the castle is still on lock down after Banyok was murdered right next to me! I have ordered him to dispatch spies to hunt down the Hashshashin and destroy them. I commissioned him a third of the treasury and sent him off to do his work.

[**20th October 1203:**](http://min.us/lNHWUjzpxY9LE) 

I have had it with these damn rebels! It seems every day I have more peasants cropping up in rebellion in more and more provinces, refusing to work and in some cases, attempting to take the province for themselves! I was content with having them peacefully settle down, but everywhere I look my people are unfaithful! It seems I cannot rule with kindness, so I shall rule with fear. I vow that as soon as my war with Khwarzim is finished, I will slaughter all rebels, and their families. They shall learn to fear me.

[**20th December 1203:**](http://min.us/lzYWrxT8iaT42) 

Today is a day for celebration indeed! Today I received the letter of surrender from Khwarzim. I have already assembled a banquet for all at my castle, and I plan a huge feast for all my vassals to enjoy. Perhaps now that I have finished my conquest, people will learn to treat me with the fear I deserve.

[**8th January 1204:**](http://min.us/lD4HHKOLK0IaV) 

Today I had to make a hard decision. My vassal, Bey Arrak, accused my brother of inappropriately eyeing his wife, with 'lust in his eyes'. I did not want to believe such an accusation, but I know it to be true. While I was growing up, my brother would always visit brothels, and I heard rumours of him raping courtiers. He is a horrible man. When I was a child, he would always mercilessly beat me while I cried and begged for mercy. Instead of stopping he would laugh and beat me until I had no more tears to cry. I've always wanted an excuse to imprison him, now I have it. I don't feel any remorse for the monster, and I will leave him to rot in the dungeons. Also, it does not hurt that this act will gain me influence with Bey Arrak.

[**29th April 1204:**](http://min.us/lFfrAsk7zKRWU) 

It has been a long time since I have written in this diary. Truth be told, not much has happened. It has been relatively peaceful, but today marks the beginning of more bloodshed. Seven thousand men have been chosen to crush the traitors that plague my empire. Today was the first battle of many, and I have been told every single one of the rebels has either been killed or arrested in Chastye. Allahu Akbar!

**21st May 1204:**

Recently a courtier named Songul (honey to my ears, that name!) and I have been exchanging flirtatious gestures. She is beauty personified, her hair as black as coal and soft as the finest silk. Earlier today, I could contain myself no more, and I visited her chambers in the castle. I surprised her, but she was happy to give herself to me, and we had a lovely romp in the tower. I truly love her, but we both have to stay quiet, for her honour and mine.

[**22nd September 1204:**](http://min.us/lbbaGTqD2UtaTs) 

Today, I received a letter in which Timariot Yaroslav has been accused of being a heretic by my Court Imam, and he wishes of me to remove this brand. I responded, saying that my Court Imam would never be wrong in accusing a heretic, and that all shall know about his degenerate ways. I don't think he'll like it very much, but I have full faith in my Court Imam. Along with this, I wrote a letter to the Imam, applauding him for his great work and keen eye, along with a gift of money.

[**3rd January 1205:**](http://min.us/lbaWskL5CHXeaC) 

Again, it has been a while since I have written in this book. I fear I have been in a bit of a depressed state since the news of my Marshall, and friend's, death. Today, I write to say that my primary title has been changed from Volga Bulgaria, to the Empire of Rus. I have done so to distinguish myself from my ancestors, and because... I like the name better. Hopefully the peasants will embrace the new cultural identity and change in name. Rus has a certain name to it that rolls off the tongue well, certainly better than Volga Bulgaria. I have also placed a new Marshall on my council. His name is Beylerbey Honek of Perm, and he is a great commander if people are to be believed. He will serve me well, I hope.

[**28th February 1205:**](http://min.us/lbpHyxbDAIngfL) 

Allah give me strength. It has come to light that my romantic affair with Songul Kopti, my love, has produced a bastard! This is bad for both of us, as Songul is not married, and I am not married to her! I have deliberated for a while... The choice has been difficult, but I have decided to legitimize the boy. My children will hate me for it, as will my wives. But it is the good thing to do.

[**10th March 1205:**](http://min.us/lTFQFTjYR4zte) 

For the past week I have been engrossed in a strange book I found in the castle library. It tells the tale of a pilgrims journey to Mecca, and the many perils he faces. It is beautiful, and though I may struggle with some of the words, I am enamoured with this story. I am convinced that there is a deeper meaning behind this, and I will find it!

[**6th April 1205:**](http://min.us/l7wBchIL64xcH) It is time I show the might of the my great empire, and crush the forces of Hungary once and for all! They are weak and plagued by rebellions at this moment, so I must strike quickly! I have pressed my rightful claim for the region of Kiev, as it is de jure part of my lands. Hungary were my fathers enemies, and they are now mine. I have no kindness in my heart for the infidels of Catholic Europe, and they will all be crushed, beginning with Hungary. Allahu Akbar! I have called my brother in law, Sultan Aydin of Khiva, into my war, in return for joining his already won conquest. Although I doubt Aydin will actually send any troops, it is worth the gamble I reckon. Anyway, Aydins enemies do not pose a threat to us.

5btzh2,Scandinavian Empire help,"So I've been playing a Sigurdr Ring start as my 1st ironman run, and it's taught me a lot about the game (in other words, I've made some pretty bad mistakes).

I didn't manage gavelkind early on, Danmark has been independent for quite a while.  I messed up an election by allowing an Orthodox to be my heir, which screwed up my plans to reform the faith.  I managed to convert back to Germanic and do damage control, but my ruler died before I amassed enough wealth for me to consider going feudal.

Later on things took a turn for the worse when I had my ruler die in his 40's and ended up with ANOTHER Orthodox character.  I couldn't convert this time, but I made sure my heir was pagan.  My next mistake was granting independence to a faction where I didn't check closely enough what all was in it.  I ended up losing most of Irland.

My biggest mistake came next, a faction that had way more manpower than I (since gavelkind had been raping my demesne) declared another king emperor.  I accepted and ended up a vassal to this new emperor, which I didn't realize it what would happen.  

The good news is Irland came back to me after the king died, and I was able to make myself heir to the empire title.  The bad news is this asshole emperor has lived to be 62 (was already pretty old when he took over) and he's Catholic.  He forced all his vassals to convert (although I resisted) and since he controls most of the holy sites, I can't reform the Germanic faith despite again being pagan.

My question is, should I keep playing this playthrough?  I don't know how likely reforming the faith will be after Emperor asshole dies, and I'll probably have a lot of pissed off Catholic vassals once I get the empire back.  

I could just convert to Catholicism and use that route to go feudal.  I was working my Tribal Authority (non-conclave) up to eventually go feudal, but it looks like Emperor Asshole has managed to max out Tribal Authority in the Empire.

However, I feel like starting over would go a lot smoother.  I think it might be easier to start over rather than pick up the pieces.  I just recently had to white-peace a claim of Sjalland against Danmark when they came up with 10K troops instead of the 2K I was expecting.  

TL:DR, made a bunch of noob mistakes in Ironman, should I start over or try to pick up the pieces?

Any thoughts on what I should do at this point?  I definitely need to get better at assessing what event troops/mercs/holy orders an opponent might be able to deploy.  ",3,3,0,0.4019,0.574,0.426,0.0,-0.9648,0.101,0.768,0.131
1gz22y,Some tips and random thoughts for a Rurik ToG start and non-Norse pagans in general (long),"So, I just “finished” my first ToG playthrough, starting as Rurik in 867AD. Finished, as in, did everything I wanted to do, which was to create the Russian Empire, turn my dynasty Slavic and Russian, reform the faith, spread my seed far and wide – the usual stuff.

So, for anyone who doesn’t know, Rurik starts off with godly stats, is really kind of a badass, and is culturally and religiously Norse, whereas his unlanded son starts off with so-so stats and is culturally Norse, but is already converted to the new homeland’s Slavic faith.  

**So, there’s two ways to go** – keep your dynasty pure Norse and enjoy all of the ToG Norse-specific mechanics, or do what the game suggests and embrace Mother Russia, convert your dynasty to be Russian and Slavic and enjoy the plump women and the pickles.

I went the latter route and I gotta say the loss of Norse-specific extras is a little painful. All the flavor events are gone, which is a shame, but the inability to use rivers is the thing that causes the most serious pain considering how vast and slow to traverse Mother Russia is. You also lose out on the blot and the rune stone, and only have access to the jarilo festival, which is still pretty powerful  since it gives you 100 piety and +15 opinion across the board. Mind you, until you’re not totally culturally/religiously pure, triggering jarilo will result in all your non-Slavs refusing to attend, which gives an opinion penalty instead of a bonus.

**The most useful trick** by far for making the best of the 30 or so years you’re going to have as a Norse ruler (and the rest as a Slavic pagan) is to conquer Narva and turn it into a vassal Republic. Rurik, unlike the other starting Norse characters, gets no access to boats – I mean none whatsoever – and getting boats through tech + buildings is a long-term undertaking. By turning Narva into a vassal Republic, you get instant access to a decent stack of boats you can use to load up a bunch of raiders and do some serious raping, looting and pillaging.

You start off with the ‘become king of Rus’ ambition, which means you can use the Subjugation CB as much as you want and you should  be able to create the Kingdom of Rus within a few years. The Conquest CB will allow you to pick up a whole lot of random counties in de-jure Ruthenia, which is the other kingdom title you’ll need to create your empire down the road. The duchy you start off with has 6 counties – of which you own two and can plot to revoke the rest, so that’s a pretty overpowered starting condition as well.

Parking your spy down in Muslim lands and everyone else but your chancellor in your capital will let you catch up with tech and since Rurik starts off with off-the-chart stats, you’ll be accumulating quite a few tech points. Within 60 years, I had Legalism and Military Organization at 4. And remember, if you decide to reform the faith and still have some unreformed pagan lands to conquer, you’re going to have to deal with pagan attrition unless you get your Military Organization to 4.

**The biggest problem** by far is that playing pagan you have some serious limitations as to who you can marry. The ‘will not marry an infidel’ penalty is pretty ridiculous and will hopefully be tweaked in a later patch. I managed a decent marriage for my son just once in the entire 90 year playthrough – to the Queen of Pommerania, who was the only high-ranking Slav left on the map. Once my realm expanded to include all the Slavic counties on the map, I could literally find no one to marry other than people in my own realm, and since I seriously overspread my dynasty (90+ living members), I was pretty much marrying within the family like a stinking Zoroastrian.

**By far the most fun thing** to happen in this playthrough (other than Tengri Carpathia becoming bigger than the HRE and the Byzantines combined are in a normal 1066 start) was a stray kinsman of mine – a proper Rurikovich who just happened to be Norse/Norse – triggering a prepared invasion on Sarkel, marching across Russia with his 17K doomstack, conquering Sarkel, then Cumania and in the process marrying a Slavic woman and converting to the Slavic faith. So, in the end, I ended up with this huge buffer zone to the south that is controlled by a member of my dynasty and of my own faith. Sometimes it’s a boatload of fun  watching the AI do its thing.

**tl;dr** – It’s a fun and easy start, but going Russian/Slavic deprives you of a lot of flavor events and Norse-specific game mechanics, the ‘will not marry an infidel’ penalty is pretty ridiculous, be careful when reforming your faith and make sure you can get your Military Organization to level 4 to avoid pagan attrition, make sure to create a vassal Republic so you can have access to boats.

The vile pagans of the far north, the Norse, threaten the very heart of Christendom as they raid and pillage their way across the coast of the cold sea. The Slavic barbarians knock at her eastern door, emerging from the dark forests, as if born from them to bring the devils wrath upon us. To the south the followers of the false prophet, Mohammad, come forth from the scorching desert, bring their fiery lies and hot steel to bare against our ally.

In these desperate times will you be one to protect the cross through the ages, or will you try to see it torn down and dragged into disgrace? Will you seek out the riches of the new world for faith or national glory? How will you deal with the advent of the gun and invention of the tank? Finally how can one handle the greatest war ever fought? Can you raise to the challenge or like Rome will you pass quickly into the night never seeing your glory last the ages? Pick your land wisely and try to survive in the world of the Paradoxical Millennium!""

With the message the delivered the man stands there, waiting with hand outstretched. Will you accept the call and take his hand, or pass up the chance that will never come around again!

The Summary
_______________________________________________________
So now that I hopefully have your attention, or you just skipped to this part, I will explain what I am proposing. For those who haven't guessed by now, this is a Crusader Kings 2 grand campaign, where the aim would be to go through all of the paradox games all the way through Hearts of Iron. Though that would be long way off and the game we decide for that can come later, as first I want to see if there are people interested in this. To me Crusader Kings 2 is a great game, but the AI no longer possess any challenge and I also wish to share my love of this game with other people. I want to share my stories and weird lineages with others in real time and see just what the world will look like with multiple human players.

So this game would happen once, twice, or more a week whatever people can manage. I also would like this to not be just a paint the map my color, and would like AI to exist and still have presence, unless I get a lot of us. So this game is much more focused on the dynasties and stories we wish to tell and create together. If this sounds interesting to you then look over the next sections, the rules, technical information, and etc., and make sure you can abide by the.
