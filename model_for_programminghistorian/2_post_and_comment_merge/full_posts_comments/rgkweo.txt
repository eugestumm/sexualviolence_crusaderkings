My liege (and ally) went to war and I got pillaged

Im not understanding something.  


My liege went to war with my neighbor. For some reason I was dragged into the conflict automatically and my neighbor (just a few steps away) assaulted my capital before I could even raise my army.  


Meanwhile my liege, and supposed ally, just went and assaulted a completely different area while my lands were raped and pillaged.  


How do I avoid this terrible outcome in the future?

U know how feudal system work?

So "your land" is also your liege's land.  And for your neighbor to siege yours down advanced your neighbor's war goals.

You can pin your liege as a person of interest and get more notifications about them, I think. That might help you be more aware of the dangers.

Revolt and become your own Liege. Yhen when you get pillaged, you will have only yourself to blame.
