**The diary of King Belasko**, *as written by /u/phargmin*

[25 September, 997](http://i.imgur.com/nR5CNZQ.jpg)

My father, Beltran, has been taken to Allah.  At his bedside, with his dying breath, he urged me to strike down our enemies and bring glory back to House Neffarako.  An old man, he himself had lacked only the time to expand our lands.  A man in middle age myself, I know that my time on our ancestral throne will not be long.

Today at my coronation I, [Belasko](http://i.imgur.com/5dIg5Hp.jpg), the first of my name, King of Navare and Scourge of Iberia promised to pick up the sword immediately, and reign fire down upon our enemies, in whatever way possible.

My [first](http://i.imgur.com/gEJHXnd.jpg) mission was to secure an alliance with our neighbors of the faith in Iberia.  I have been blessed with many sisters and daughters, enough to weave a web of alliances large enough to protect us.  The Sultan is not interested in taking another wife, but if one of his were to fall to a tragic accident...

[15 February, 999](http://i.imgur.com/rg1TXPA.jpg)

Though I had promised to strike quickly, I have found that time flies when dealing with the various affairs of court.  Eventually, I had to stop my councilors and declare that today we will wage war!  I am yet untested in battle, and so expanding into Sardinia may be an excellent stepping-stone to glory.

[5 August, 1000](http://i.imgur.com/iLYyWPE.jpg)

Our chance has come.  While campaigning in Sardinia I was sent a letter by raven informing me that the Duke of Barcelona had stricken his banners and declared himself separate from West Francia.  This was it.  No stepping-stone.  An enemy as great as ourselves.  One outcome glory, the other utter defeat.

[26 February, 1002](http://i.imgur.com/QjvLSHK.jpg)

After 2 years of campaigning, here I stand atop Barcelona's highest hill, the city sacked beneath me.  The Duke has been captured and with a single swing of my sword his head rolled down the steps of the city's grandest cathedral.  I declared this land part of Navare, and have appointed one of my most trusted and skilled men to govern the city and surrounding provinces in my name.  Today I have brought glory to House Neffarako.  No longer will the peoples of Europe think of us as irrelevant.  They will rue the day they threw my people out of our homeland.

[12 January, 1005](http://i.imgur.com/w4Crate.jpg)

I have continued to expand across Iberia.  Every chance I get, I strike out against the surrounding peoples. The smaller ones have been conquered, and now only the larger states remain.

[6 January, 1006](http://i.imgur.com/FcYEqyI.jpg)

I have not slept in days.  West Francia, our greatest enemy, has called a holy war for their former territory of Barcelona.  I have raised the banners, but can still only muster one man for every 5 that the enemy can.  Fortunately, all my hard work over the past decade has paid off.  I sent heralds to my allies asking them to uphold the alliances I have forged.  Tens of thousands of men are rushing to our aid, including many sell swords.

[19 April, 1006](http://i.imgur.com/SsNLbku.jpg)

I have done a very bad thing this day.  While waiting for my army to assemble, I took some time to inquire about my sons.  I am growing in age and will need a suitable replacement.  We will need a skilled diplomat to keep the realm from bleeding.  I spent a few days with my first son and heir, [Beltran](http://i.imgur.com/sYoIukG.jpg).  I could not believe my eyes.  Though thoroughly skilled in the lists and in battle, he is an imbecile.  Beltran is lazy, wroth, and even worse - can not handle the intricacies of court whatsoever.  After many sleepless nights, I knew that my second son, Belasko, should succeed me.  He excels better than my own self at court, and he has an incredibly virtuous lifestyle.  And so, though it violated all laws of gods and men, I had Beltran imprisoned and then executed.  It was not popular with the people, nor with my councilors.  Even my own kin hates me know.  But though they can not see it, everything I do is for the realm. 

[14 July, 1006](http://i.imgur.com/8KmkcsP.jpg)

Today I have a grandchild.  Hopefully my heir's heir.  There has never been a more beautiful babe, he will woo the hearts of many women and bring great glory to our house, I can tell.

All of these distractions of the past few months have made me sway from our primary goal.  The Francians and their alliance of nearly half of Europe still plague our lands.  In the end however, we [prevailed](http://i.imgur.com/DTmK6q0.jpg). 

[7 September, 1007](http://i.imgur.com/RnQ4VnX.jpg)

Though they begged for mercy, I pursued my enemy into his own lands.  As we came upon the grand city of Paris, I instructed my army to sack the city.  Free reign was given to the men to burn their homes, rape their women, and raze the city to the ground.  As far as I know, I am the first Muslim to have sacked a city so far North.  The history books will remember me and House Neffarako for this day.  Bloodied and wounded, their King was carried before me and propped up on his knees.  As he looked up into my eyes, he pleaded for mercy and [surrendered](http://i.imgur.com/ILAb7Sq.jpg).  I have done good this day.

[14 December, 1007](http://i.imgur.com/DCZxfIG.jpg)

I thirst for battle.  It has scarce been two moons since I have pushed back the Northern invaders, and I have already set my sights to the West.  King Jean of Austurias is weak, and with all the men at my back it would be wasteful to not take this opportunity and expand our lands. The fools couldn't even put up a [fight](http://i.imgur.com/qtHPrvN.jpg).  I am happy, for our lands have now [tripled](http://i.imgur.com/XMUmQI8.jpg) under my reign and we are now a force to be reckoned with.

[22 December, 1009](http://i.imgur.com/i96Oxed.jpg)

Strange, pale men from the far North landed on the shores of my homeland.  With them, an army to sack and pillage my people.

I threw them back into the sea.

[14 June, 1010](http://i.imgur.com/2nyIWCG.jpg)

The Caliph has called all holy men to reclaim Jerusalem from the Westerners.  I agree to help, but decide to first spend my energies elsewhere...

[22 July, 1011](http://i.imgur.com/rxF4smW.jpg)

Asturias has fractured even more.  Now is the chance to expand.  Iberia shall be ours.  I did not even have to call on my vassals to [win](http://i.imgur.com/fshBIRG.jpg).

[9 September, 1014](http://i.imgur.com/9z9Hvcr.jpg)

An opportunity has arisen to expand to a far away land.  The Christians are strong here.  While I will not sit in the shade of this tree I have planted, hopefully my son will, and his sons after that.

[15 February, 1015](http://i.imgur.com/Ce7dhhi.jpg)

Finally, at last I set foot upon the holy soil.  With my brothers in Allah around me, I finally take back land...that I will never [rule](http://i.imgur.com/vrJfOSy.jpg)?  A pity that I could not rule over this fair country.

[26 May, 1015](http://i.imgur.com/fs4Zk1G.jpg)

I do not feel well.  Breathing comes hard to me, and I know that my time has come.  Though I have not yet reigned for two decades, ruling has taken a great toll on my health.  I look back on all my accomplishments and know that I have brought great glory to House Neffarako.  I have done horrible things, but all for family and the realm.  In my last few months as I feel my strength ebbing away, I know that my son Belasko, the Second of His Name, will do a fine job ruling our fair land and expanding the horizons of Navare even farther.

And so the Neffarako line is returned to Iberia! And it only took 100 years or so. I wonder if our capital will stay in New Navarre or move back to its ancestral location?

I'm relatively inexperienced and curious how you usurped the county of Oriel

Belasko II has the same stash as Belasko I!
