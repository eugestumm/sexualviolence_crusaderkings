The Paradoxical Millennium Needs You!

The Call is Given!
_______________________________________________________
A messenger arrives at the gates of your small castle, his banner unlike any that you've seen before. The man was cloaked in dusty world warn garbs, yet still something compelled you to let him in. The aura emanating from him feels as if he was sent by the God himself, or perhaps he is an angel in human form. Whatever the case may be you now find this strange visage of a man in front of you, standing in your throne room staring at you. The silence only eventually broken by his booming voice as he delivers his singular message.

"The Roman Empire of the west has collapsed and faded in decadence at the hands of the barbarians. Her lands split between new and old rulers alike, those that remain loyal to the one true God! Yet still these lands are plagued by the vile heathens of the north, the heretics to the south and east. They pillage the land, raping it of its worth and leaving nothing for those bastions of the faith.

The vile pagans of the far north, the Norse, threaten the very heart of Christendom as they raid and pillage their way across the coast of the cold sea. The Slavic barbarians knock at her eastern door, emerging from the dark forests, as if born from them to bring the devils wrath upon us. To the south the followers of the false prophet, Mohammad, come forth from the scorching desert, bring their fiery lies and hot steel to bare against our ally.

In these desperate times will you be one to protect the cross through the ages, or will you try to see it torn down and dragged into disgrace? Will you seek out the riches of the new world for faith or national glory? How will you deal with the advent of the gun and invention of the tank? Finally how can one handle the greatest war ever fought? Can you raise to the challenge or like Rome will you pass quickly into the night never seeing your glory last the ages? Pick your land wisely and try to survive in the world of the Paradoxical Millennium!"

With the message the delivered the man stands there, waiting with hand outstretched. Will you accept the call and take his hand, or pass up the chance that will never come around again!

The Summary
_______________________________________________________
So now that I hopefully have your attention, or you just skipped to this part, I will explain what I am proposing. For those who haven't guessed by now, this is a Crusader Kings 2 grand campaign, where the aim would be to go through all of the paradox games all the way through Hearts of Iron. Though that would be long way off and the game we decide for that can come later, as first I want to see if there are people interested in this. To me Crusader Kings 2 is a great game, but the AI no longer possess any challenge and I also wish to share my love of this game with other people. I want to share my stories and weird lineages with others in real time and see just what the world will look like with multiple human players.

So this game would happen once, twice, or more a week whatever people can manage. I also would like this to not be just a paint the map my color, and would like AI to exist and still have presence, unless I get a lot of us. So this game is much more focused on the dynasties and stories we wish to tell and create together. If this sounds interesting to you then look over the next sections, the rules, technical information, and etc., and make sure you can abide by the.
