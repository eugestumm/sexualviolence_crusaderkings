Question on Adventurers

I am playing Ironmen Mode, i started as Norse-Count of Oriel and conquered all of Ireland besides Dublin(also norse no casus belli) and now i just on a prepared invasion against Scottland(100% warscore so thats not the problem).

Now a former irish lord is gathering troops to attack me and i am scared like hell.
Is there any way to know how many troops he will have?
I also killed most of his friends and rape his Woman and sister,

So at 882AD i have 3k Gold and around 6k troops including both merc bands i could hire.
But my chance to assassinate him is around 9% and my plot to kill him failed as noone likes me for whatever reason :(

So should i drop 3k Gold on a 9% chance or shall i just fight, anyone every got raped my 15k stacks this early?

Well [here](http://imgur.com/2Vu6ITf)'s how you tell how many troops he has. In my experience, they usually won't invade until they at least outnumber your regular levy. I recommend saving your money for as many mercenaries as possible, but don't hire them until the invasion actually kicks off. Also, take note of whose court he is hiding in; if he has to take ships to get to you (likely, since you're in Ireland), you can probably catch him on the beaches.

Just assassinate the adventurer before he declares war.  The invasion dies with him.  However once he launches, he's got a temp title so you can't kill him anymore.

You will never ever beat off an adventurer with 6K levies plus 3K gold worth of mercs.  Your best bet would have been to plop your spymaster on him to build spy network and spam assassinate attempts while hoping your plot comes good.
