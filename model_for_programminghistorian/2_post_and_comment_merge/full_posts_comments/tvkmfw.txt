What would the Visigoths call the Kingdom of Maghreb

Started playing as Pelagio Qutid in 769, the last Visigoth in Africa and son of Julian of Ceuta (dude who allowed the Umayyads into Iberia for revenge against King Roderic's rape of his daughter). I intend to mass convert to catholicism once I've amassed enough power to fight against the Umayyads and I already own almost all of dejure Maghreb aside from 3 counties.  


What the Visigoths of that time called Mahgreb/that region? I know Tangier would've been called Tingis (stemming from Roman occupation centuries before).

If there's a common theme of Roman/Latin names it would be called it would be mauretania.
