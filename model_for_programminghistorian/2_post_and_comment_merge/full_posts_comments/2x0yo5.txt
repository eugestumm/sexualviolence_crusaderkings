Tips for playing Saxony?

I'm trying to get into playing some pagans in ironman mode, but I'm not sure how I'm meant to survive as Saxony (Charlemagne start). I get off to a decent start and then get raped by Charlemagne himself! What am I meant to do?

Stockpile prestige beforehand, enough to summon at least 5k troops (should be easy with blots, steward, and other stuff). Use your Pagan Attrition. Your provinces have a supply limit of 1k at most, compared to Charlie's armies of 8k in one province. By then, you should have an army of about 10k of you+event troops+vassal allies. If you wait for a little, it'll be a curbstomb battle.
