Could I be the victim of Satanic rape?

So I've had six kids on my current Empress. 4 sons and 2 daughters. One daughter died early from the flu while two sons have currently grown up to be decent chaps. The youngest two are still not of age. Oldest one got a stroke at age 25 and died not long after. Now the second oldest got a stroke at age 24 and died. All the times there are references to my youngest son being happy when shit like that happens. 

However I'm not a satanist. Not a member of the satanic society or anything and only slept with my husbands(two died, on the third one now). So could I be the victim of Satan bluffing me into impregnating me and creating a demon child? Court Chaplain said when the rumors began that little Alfonso wasn't a demon child, but I'm beginning to wonder...

its not a society thing, the demon child can happen naturally

Saw the title and had to double check the sub. We need another crusade.
