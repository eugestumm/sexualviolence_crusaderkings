I wish I could quit my blobbing addiction .

Only work around so far I‚Äôve found is to abandon current empires and start new ones which works decently but I would really just like to try staying small the entire game but every game I set out to do this I see just a bit more of land that I can add then before you know it your massive and your vassal Kings are out raping the world üåç . You could put a stop to it eventually with laws but you enjoy it too much like a sick addiction. Then they make your borders look crappy and you end up taking more land just to make the borders appear better . It‚Äôs never ending even if I give up the empire I know eventually I will end up in the same place.

One way to avoid blobbing is giving kingdoms to your sons/brothers, give them independence and form an alliance to help them stay on the throne until they get a good grip on their realm. This way your main kingdom stays relatively within its borders and you get to see your dynasty on different thrones.

There's nothing wrong with blobbing if you enjoy it. I do. However, a change every time in a while is always welcome. Yoy can set yourself different goals, like putting relatives in foreign thrones.
