When the king of Denmark pisses you off so much that you decapitate his 1-year-old girl, hang his vassals, and rape his wife



I usually like to turn the wife to my side. Make her love me and completely break the other characters spirit. Then toss her into a pit with a bear. Its an emotional vortex.

There is something rotten in the state of Denmark.

Well, *someone* has been getting into the spirit of christmas!

Yeah I think at that point it's more about what's wrong with *you.*

And even with all those terrible things you have done to him he still doesn't consider you to be his rival.
