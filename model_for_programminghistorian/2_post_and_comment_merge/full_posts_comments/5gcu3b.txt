I hate the Aztecs

Soooo I just experienced the Aztecs for the first time ever, and..... what the hell just happened? They are impossible to beat! Maybe once those event troops go away I can do something. But they just raped me (Emperor of Alba) and the King of France -_-

They are there to rape. I love the situation where you hate those guys.

oh the irony

They are very possible to beat if they don't land right on top of you. It might take a bit of experience with large scale war though. The way I did it in my most recent game:
 
* Don't face their doomstack in the field
 
* When they are taking my counties in Northeastern France I take theirs in North Africa, they freak out and start walking there with all of their army because AI is bad at boats.
 
* Meanwhile while they are retaking their African counties I'm carpet sieging the west coast of Iberia and retaking the counties they took from me in the beginning.
 
 Soon enough i have enough warscore for white peace or enforce.

 For this strategy to work there needs to be enough fodder between you that you can have the time to take counties before they walk to where you are and you need to have enough land to not go to -90 warscore from a few lost counties.

Yea the whole DLC is pretty much pointless. They get a ton of event troops and just destroy everything for a really long time. Dunno why that DLC isn't free with how tiny and annoying it is. 

Boy, I wish they were a threat in my playthrough. They dont bother to conquer more than 2-3 duchies.
