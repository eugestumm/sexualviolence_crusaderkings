While everyone is complaining about coalitions, here is my being raped by raiders



Yeeeeep, this so much. I had this particular "borkbork's host" who was 3500 men, and they regenerated 250 men per month even in my territory. I beat them they walk away and come back, again and again and *again*.

Also there were some 6 other smaller groups of raiders.

I noticed that last night that Raiders were frustrating. 

me* I can't type for shit
