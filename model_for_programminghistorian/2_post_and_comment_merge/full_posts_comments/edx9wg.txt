I’m going through religious rebellion hell with no end in sight. How do I convert to hellenic if I don’t convert immediately after forming Rome?

So I formed Rome and I made the mistake of not converting to hellenic via event. Now Orthodoxy has a religous authority of 7.3 because Orthodox Europe is getting raped by reformed Norse and Muslim Spain. Everything is on fire and every year I get three to four Cathar and Catholic Rebellions that spawn with 12k troops. I really want to expand but if I constantly have to deal with rebellions then frankly I can’t do shit. I will do anything possible to stop this, including converting everything to hellenic, if that is still possible. Tips and trick for doing so?

Orthodoxy is at 2.5 religous authority now, I need to jump ship

If I remember right, if your capitol is in Rome (or maybe anywhere in Italy... I forgot) you should get a decision to “Delve into the Classics”. Within there you should get the choice to study Roman Mythology. Then if you pick the right options you’ll be on an event chain that leads to you converting to Hellenic
