Trying to take over Sweden as the Republic of Gotland, not going so well.

My main problem is that it's an island and getting troops to and from the mainland is expensive and time consuming.  Twice now I've lost wars because my island (the only province I have) got occupied while my troops were on the mainland (and even if I got them back home in time they would get slaughtered the moment they stepped off the boats.)  Currently my retinue cap is 3 cultural retinues, once I get it up to 6 (so I can keep 3 at home and send the other 3 out with my levies to rape and pillage) will I be able to start seizing trade posts and counties like I did as an Italian?

I would try and get a county in somewhere like Lithuania or Finland and conquer the small tribes untill I eventually hold my own kingdom worth in duchies, then revolt, that way it's kingdom v kingdom.

On a different tack, you may want to increase the fortifications of your capital city; city holdings generally have lower fort levels than barony-type holdings. The higher the fort level, the long it takes for them to actually take Gotland in a siege.

As for expansion opportunities; you may want to take the Baltic territories. Not Finland; the land's there too poor for significant fleets without significant investment.
