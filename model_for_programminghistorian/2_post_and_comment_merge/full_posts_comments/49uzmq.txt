This game have changed me.

I started as a daughter to the king of The Reach. Older brother was obviously next in line for the crown, he has no kids. 

Thinking "How do I get that crown instead..."

Plan forms.

Act on brilliant plan.

I kidnap brother

I rape brother...

... A few times.

Bun in over, finally.

Daughter born not inbred, but Quick instead.

Daughter is next in line after older brother.

Declare war on my father the king to install older brother.

Before I win, I castrate older brother and torture him.

Win war older dying brother is now king.

He dies weeks later.

My heir is now Queen.

I was so damn proud, and now I'm thinking about what I've done.

Which mods did you use, you little family kidnapper/raper/slayer/castrater/torturer?

Raping family members is just common occurrence and a valid strategy in CK2, pretty much business as usual.

It's only in hindsight you realize what a horrible monster you've become

Wow, I really need to get this mod.
