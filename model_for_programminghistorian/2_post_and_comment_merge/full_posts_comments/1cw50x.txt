**The diary of King Oswulf 'the Kinslayer' d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/NecroKnight*

**September 26, 1246:** 

[My name is King Oswulf I of Syria](http://i.imgur.com/QLcEY99.jpg). I am not a good man. I have killed my own; tortured those who deserve no torture, and let good men die in my place. Due to my Nephew’s incredible ineptness I have inherited a mere sliver of what my family once owned. Due to his incompetence [I did what I had to do… ](http://i.imgur.com/8qzsVPj.jpg). I am 48, and surrounded by vast empires and living on borrowed time… I do not have long in this world.

[**October 2, 1246:**](http://i.imgur.com/yRZOXFH.jpg)

I have no need for a vassal… I moved my armies south and sent riders ahead to let the Count of Al Jazira know that his services are no longer needed. 

[**October 5, 1246:**](http://i.imgur.com/X54Z2gX.jpg) 

Duchess Judit II of Tabriz wishes for me to assist her in her conflict, I cannot believe her nerve. How dare she ask for help from me, when mere years earlier she was leading a rebellion against my cousin and dividing my inheritance! She shall receive no help from me! 

[**March 15, 1247:**](http://i.imgur.com/5RQnKth.jpg)

The pope’s ambassador has contacted me with a proposal… He will forgive me of my “kinslaying” if I but pay him a hefty price… The Papacy is corrupt, but I need the show of redemption to help me rebuild my realm. 

[**July 14, 1247:**](http://i.imgur.com/VxNNdgC.jpg)

These barbarian bastards! Who do they think they are usurping my titles! 

[**July 23, 1247:**](http://i.imgur.com/PN6QN7j.jpg) 

Dear Lord, they have come… I have failed my family… The Mongols have sent their emissaries and they spoke of only one thing. War. 

**Aug 19, 1247:** 

Huge armies mass to the north and the south of me. Their forces outnumber mine 15-1. I have no allies… My family is divided and will not come to my aid and [I cannot afford mercenaries…](http://i.imgur.com/SPh3GEL.jpg). I will fight. I may be a fat pig… but I will not be the last of family to rule these lands.

**Aug 28, 1247:** 

The war goes badly… I write as we march to meet the enemy in battle. I… I do not know what I have done. I am a cruel man. My wife… I love her… but my son… my heir… he is unlanded and I, I am about to lose everything my family has fought for. My wife… She is duchess of Poland… [with her death](http://i.imgur.com/WyEhIga.jpg) my son is now a Duke of Poland… he is safe. He is far from this hell-damned land. Maybe one day he will lead an army back to this place and reclaim our kingdom. 

**Aug 30, 1247:** 

They call me “The Kinslayer,” but they do not understand why I have done what I have. I will be known as Oswulf the damned or the useless, but I have only done what I have for my family… my blood.

[**September 13, 1247:**](http://i.imgur.com/tqXQOnm.jpg) 

My people, my Kingdom, if I can even call it that, will all be lost if I do nothing, but even I fight there is no chance for victory. I have decided to lead my men into battle. I may be scholar and poet, I may be unfit and untrained in war, but I will fight with my men and hopefully, hopefully, die with them as Syrians. 

**October 14-22, 1247:** 

The battle from the moment it began was a rout. Baron Ademar was killed in the first day of fighting and the right flank collapsed almost immediately afterwards. [On October 21 the Pope sent ambassadors with chests full of gold to help with the war effort](http://i.imgur.com/rwJpV1B.jpg). A mere day later [the battle was done.](http://i.imgur.com/NQip4ij.jpg) My men were almost all dead or if not that, wounded. My horse was slain in combat as well as almost all of my honor guard. It’s like God taunts me. I am alive, but everyone else is dead. And he sends me gold… when I need him most he sends me gold… 

**November 15, 1247:** 

My capital has been occupied, my people raped and murdered, [and my land destroyed](http://i.imgur.com/YIrHJpT.jpg).  I, like the coward I am, hide in a squalid ruin of a castle… I have decided to surrender… [there is no point in continuing this suffering.](http://i.imgur.com/PqnUaPT.jpg). 

**June 30, 1249:** 

It has been a year and a half since my defeat at the hands of the Mongol horde… my council has told me that they successfully [engineered a claim on the county of Bira.](http://i.imgur.com/k5rLk49.jpg). The armies have been raised and the mercenaries bought; hopefully I have enough money to keep the mercenaries employed. 

**Dec 27, 1250:** 

My funds are nonexistent and I am unable to keep the mercenaries employed any longer. As of today I have released them. I am hoping that my own vassals and men will be able to finish the war. 

**April 30, 1251:** 

That bastard! That fucking bastard! My own Spymaster blackmails me!? That whore-spawn bastard! How dare he! He calls me a craven, and threatens to tell everyone what really happened during the Syrian-Mongol War. [50 gold!](http://i.imgur.com/FGAoxGU.jpg) I do not have 50 gold, but I couldn’t let my vassals and servants know of my cowardice during the war… I… I had to pay. This whole debacle has angered me so greatly that after dinner [I think I’m going to pay my prisoner a very long visit…](http://i.imgur.com/WVE1kMU.jpg).

**November 12, 1251:** 

My allies will not join me, I cannot afford any mercenaries, and my army is too small to successfully lay siege to my enemy’s holdings… All the money I do make is immediately spent on supplying my army with food and supplies… It has become a waiting game with no clear ending in sight.

**April 29, 1255:** 

The war continues. No new ground has been covered in the last 3 and half years. My vassals openly mock me and the servants are always whispering secrets when they walk by me. I have become so bored lately that not even my books amuse me anymore… Thank God for the dungeons and its never ending supply of… entertainment. 

[**Aug 9, 1256:**](http://i.imgur.com/LVpoYrn.jpg)

Novgorod has been sacked! I remember reading about this place in one of my books… If I remember correctly it’s not to far from where my son’s lands are… I hope he is okay… I have not heard from him since his mother’s… death. 

**July 18, 1257:** 

[My steward has been openly stealing from my coffers for the past 10 years!](http://i.imgur.com/zA6nuCl.jpg). All I wanted to do was to kill him, hang him from the roof, and skin him like a beast. My council advised a different route though… My council advised me to force my former steward to repay all the money he has taken. At first I was hesitant, but with this money I could end my war with the Count of Bira once and for all. 

[**July 29, 1257:**](http://i.imgur.com/d7Ojz4A.jpg)

With my coffers filled I’ll finally be able to storm my opponent’s holdings and put an end to this war. 

[**Feb 24, 1258:**](http://i.imgur.com/v06F7Ud.jpg)

I received terrible news today… A man dressed in tattered and dirty clothes arrived bearing a message for me. He was an unusually looking man and sounded like my wife’s old servants… It turns out he was one of my son’s knights… My son had died at the hands of the Mongols. My grandson, a mere boy, is now my heir. 

[**March 31, 1258:**](http://i.imgur.com/wCBanA7.jpg) 

The Count of Bira has surrendered! The war is finally over.  

[**October 9, 1258:**](http://i.imgur.com/0m9Z6N9.jpg) 

My advisors suggested I find a new wife, but I do not know if I am ready to wed a new wife. My advisor Thedosius suggested I marry the Empress of the Byzantine Empire… She’s 6 though… 

[**June 20, 1261:**](http://i.imgur.com/pSpdxvi.jpg) 

A famous historian has nicknamed me Oswulf the fat and it has caught on with my vassals… I have decreed the nickname to be outlawed and any who say it shall be killed. 

**July 13, 1262:** 

I have noticed many of my unlanded family members dying… I don’t really mind though, the influx of cash is quite nice. 

[**Sep 3, 1263:**](http://i.imgur.com/FiDafnL.jpg) 

A couple tried to elope, but they were caught by the provincial guardsmen and brought to court for judgment. I was having a bad day and by the time they arrived my attitude has soured… I banished both of them from my realm and took all other possessions.  

[**March 23, 1264:**](http://i.imgur.com/vUHWg1P.jpg)

A claim has been successfully made on the county of Acre… The counties of Jerusalem are in rebellion and ripe for picking. I have decided to put my overflowing coffers to use and conquer Acre in the name of my family. 

[**Aug 27, 1264:**](http://i.imgur.com/yEV1ICi.jpg) 

The Mongols have sacked Krakow… That’s quite close to my grandson’s land… I hope all is well with him. 

**Nov 20, 1264:** 

We are victorious! [Acre is ours and we finally have a safe haven from the Mongol hordes.](http://i.imgur.com/uRDLTTc.jpg) 

**June 6, 1265:** 

My Grandson’s lands have been lost to the golden hoard… I… everything is for naught… We are now trapped in this forsaken barren land. I killed my beloved for nothing… I… I am worthless.

**June 31, 1265:** 

[**At age 65 King Oswulf I has died of a heartattack.**](http://i.imgur.com/TzPaL17.jpg).

[**Long live King Nabdor!**](http://i.imgur.com/7jea5V8.jpg)

I tried my best, but I was being perpetually fucked by everyone. 

>They call me “The Kinslayer,” but they do not understand why I have done what I have. I will be known as Oswulf the damned or the useless, but I have only done what I have for my family… my blood.

This is really the line we'll remember you by. I don't think I've been as drawn in during this succession game since Serlo. I can't believe how you were willing to do the horrendous to try to save House d'Isigny, and then your sacrifice was in vain.

Massive props for doing what you could to hold on. The last entry of this writeup is just heartwrenching.

**Nickname suggestions here:** the game labeled him as "the fat" - I'm tempted to go with that, but want to see if any good options pop up before finalizing.

On the plus side, the new king is of the right age to marry the lovely young Greek Empress Oswulf had his eyes on.. 

I'm missing a few pictures and wondering if someone could help me out a little bit.  I've been really busy the past 24 hours, and haven't had a chance to fire up CK2 to take additional screenshots:

>Nov 20, 1964:

Lol. Might want to change that one.
