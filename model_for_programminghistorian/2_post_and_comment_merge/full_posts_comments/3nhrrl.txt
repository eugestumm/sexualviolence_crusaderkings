Can we please ban Anime Portraits from this subreddit? Every time someone posts it I throw up a little in my mouth.

I am sick and tired of all the stupid Anime portraits bullshit showing up in this sub and I **can't** be in the minority on this. Seeing these badly-drawn faces, all it does is make me cringe and feel sorry for whichever loser is wasting away their life drawing such garbage. 

It makes ABSOLUTELY no sense to take a game like CK2 and make it 'Anime', something with no relation to the source material whatsoever. Making a Bob's Burgers mod or the Simpson style would make just as much sense, hell, even **more** sense, and **wouldn't** make my eyes feel like they are being raped.

People make the argument "But I like not having a triple chin." No, shut up. You're missing the point of CK2. It's about being a diverse, realistic character with real flaws navigating through one of the most tumultuous periods of cultural history. Your character has a triple chin? Play a gluttonous, greedy lecher. You want the game to display when characters have the ugly/attractive traits? There are plenty of portrait improvement mods you can try out **without** having to install shitty anime faces that look like they were drawn in the margin of a middle school notebook.

I thought I would wait it out until the novelty of this cringe-inducing trash dies out but I can't wait any longer. Sorry if you actually like Anime faces (wtf is wrong with you??), but if you do you should really just create your own sub and leave the rest of us the fuck alone.

/rant.

I agree that the anime portraits seem out of place in CK2, but people have their preferences. There was no need to post a rant about it. Also why should someone create a separate subreddit just for a trivial thing like a portrait mod. 

You say that a Simpsons or Bob Burgers portrait mod would make more sense but I beg to differ as those would makes as much sense as the anime mod. The anime art style is generalized as a Japanese cartoony drawing style. Not all anime/manga are drawn cartoony  as many have a more realistic style, e.g. Vagabond or Berserk.

It quite obvious that you have a bias against anime and the people who like by calling them losers and that you pity them for liking it. I believe you're mistaking anime fans with weeaboos or hate them for no justifiable reason.

Edit: could you link the portrait improvement mods that you spoke of, as I never heard of such things.

I'm pretty sure you can just not look at the posts that have them. What's next, banning HIP, COTC, Birthright2, CK2+ and the AGOT mods because some people don't like them? You know, people have different tastes, just because some people don't like something it doesn't mean we should ban it, otherwise we'd ban all the posts with triple chin or border gore.

Really? I think they are so kawaii!(◑‿◐) (◕‿-) ✖‿✖
