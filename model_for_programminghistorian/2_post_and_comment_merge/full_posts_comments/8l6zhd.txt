How to play as a Tribal

I started a few games today as Tribal I Kiev in the earliest started. I always get gang banged by the Magyars and Bulgaria. So I started a new one as Tribal Catholic and also got raped. What are the best strategies to go as Tribal ?

Tribes are carnivores, not toothless animals like feudals. Any other ruler can generally declare war on you all the time, especially within the same de jure kingdom, and pretty much all tribal rulers have some kind of ambition to grow as fast as possible so all of their sons can inherit something. The further you go near the germanics, the worse it gets, eastern areas are harmless in comparison with the defensive pagan religions preventing tribes from eating each other with the same ease.

Generally in the tribal world, the big tribe eats the little tribe, and there is not much you can do about it if you begin as a small tribe other than follow the big one(if you even get the option) and break free after gavelkind succession fucks up the big tribe with the rulers death. 

If you do net get eaten within the first few years, raiding and building up your military buildings with prestige will make you a menace to everyone around you, as will collecting piety if you are a defensive pagan. A good marriage may save your hide multiple times within the same decade, you actually play the marriage game this time, you will need some help to stay alive against bigger tribe. Also, martial is the only attribute you give a shit about for the first decades, nothing else. Martial is much stronger in the tribal world, while the others barely do anything, and the attributes with a martial lifestyle also give you much higher opinion boosts.

Fighting other tribes is made easier by pillaging some of their holdings, then blitzing through them quickly before they can call up too many allies. Plan your wars around the troops you get from your council, having some fanatics ready can save your life in the next war.

 If there are other smaller nations around you there are not tribes go to war with them to make them tributes. They give you income since as tribe you have like none, and they also can be called into wars. The tribal army is also OP, and you want to upgrade the tribe hill\-fort to max and organize as quick as possible so you can become feudal.

Yeah, got the same problem as started Irish on Charlie date. Plotting is fun but a little slow, and I still need to figure how to get more army \(yep, newbie with less than 100h here\)

I normally play all-tribal worlds, so while I don't have a huge amount of experience with the game-in-large, I can share some secrets about how to start at the beginning.

* Choose a county where you have lots open land. Having a church/temple/bishopric there helps, too. The more open land = more levy size. My favorites are like Barcelona or Thessaloniki. Smyrna is good, too, as is Alexandria.
* Biggest thing: raid, raid, raid. Use your marshal to get raiders. Raid with them and your levies combined. Raid your neighbors, and get Shipbuilding ASAP if you are a coastal county.
* Build up your tribal capital with the prestige/gold you get from raiding.
* Raid some more.
* Have as few kids as possible, especially sons. Daughters are great for alliances.
* If you are playing Catholic, use your unwanted sons as heirs to the bishoprics (hence why you want them to start with), so they won't inherit land.
* Plan your conquests very carefully. Under gavelkind, you will lose territory as fast as your leader dies. Expand only when you can quickly go to the next level: Count -> Duke -> King. 
* Don't immediately invade when you get a claim -- only go for it when you: have enough claims to make a duchy/kingdom; can beat all the claims within a short amount of time; have enough time in your ruler's lifetime; have enough money to create the duchy/kingdom/etc.
* Keep raiding.
* Don't go feudal until all your counties are built up and will go feudal with you.
* Don't overbuild the counties -- check to make sure the buildings you are making in tribal will translate to feudal buildings when you go feudal. Usually, it's one every two: Market Town = nothing in feudal. Market Town II = Castle Town.

Probably some other things I'm leaving out. I'm still trying to balance where I should go feudal, and when. I'm usually able to go feudal (starting with Rise of Islam 633 AD) sometime in the early-to-mid 700s.

Dont be catholic for one, it pisses off your slavic neighbors. The real trick is to abuse prestige troops,for every 500 prestige you can raise 2500 troops, for every 200 piety you can raise 2000 troops in DEFENSIVE wars only.

So basically as soon as you get 500 prestige you might as well subjugate your nearest weakest neighbor (someone who recently depleted their levies.)

NEVER fight the horse lords, cavalry armies annihilate light infantry even when  its 2 to 1. If a Khan wants to make you a tributary accept it, they will be allies that you pay for, they never refuse to come help you in war and you dont suffer a prestige penalty to refuse a call to war from them.

Finally, whatever you do, dont conquer towards the byzantines cause they will eat you in one short war and revoke all your titles for being pagan.

Edit: Kiev is my favorite start.
