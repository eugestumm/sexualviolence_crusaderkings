Seriously they should balance the chance of imprisonment. Currently its ridiculous!!!

Did you remember plundering and besieging Constantinople around six times until you captured that one byzantine princess you liked to make your concubine? 

It was annoying, but balanced. 

Those times are over and thats not a good thing. Playing a horde khan made me furious beyond description as i realized: **EVERY SINGLE MOTHERF----NG TIME** my capital gets sieged down, by random plunderparties/ rebellarmies/ someone who feels like it **EVERY SINGLE ONE** of my female courtiers gets imprisoned. 

One might think they present the khans wife/daughter/sister/female relative on a silver plate to everyone who randomly passes by. "Hey, wanna steal my liege's daughter to rape her furiously? Here she is, he won't be able to do anything cause his army needs one extra day to arrive. We didn't even bother saving/hiding her to make it easier for you."

Note: your vassal or tributaries vassal can plunder your capital and take your women as concubine, and you don't even get a casus belli or reason for imprisonment.

And then things are getting even more pathetic: One time I got revenge by sieging his camp and took all is females.

What happened? 

We both held each others wifes/ concubines/daughters hostage, but nobody was able to mediate a Prisoner exchange (Feature needed beyond repair), nor to buy their freedom, as 110 per female are beyond anyones earlygame purse.

So the alan whoreson started blinding my women... one after the other, first my wife.... then my concubines.... then my sweet little daughters (2* strong + 1* genius + 1* normal).
Something snapped inside me. For every blinding I executed one of his. I even attacked his liege, just to make him landless and killed anyone of that family I could reach.

Please make it more balanced, or I will devolve into a cruel sociopath, blinding, raping, castrating, and seduce the relatives and wifes of and everyone I can get my hands on.... well, I mean more than usual

Thanks for your time. I would appreciate your opinions.
