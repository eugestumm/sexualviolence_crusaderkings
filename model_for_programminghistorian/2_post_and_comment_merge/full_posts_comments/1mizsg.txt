Help me I am Imprisoned for rape!!

So I have been imprisoned for about 10 years now because some vassal claimed I raped my liege's daughter...  I am currently a part of the faction for independence which is quickly gaining steam.  I have the money for the ransom, but he will not accept.  Any tips on how to get out of prison? 

do you have a claim on his title if so he will never let you out I recommend dying by putting a terrible spymaster and then you have to try to assassinate some one with high chance of being caught and hope he succeeds counter assassinating you. If you don't have claims on his title it is because he dislikes you so just gift him some money and send your chancellor to improve relations.

You'd think you'd be depressed from being in prison for that long in game so you'd have the option to commit suicide from the intrigue menu.

Bribe your liege's vassals. If one likes you enough, he'll petition you have you released, or attempt to smuggle you out. 

Is this with a mod?
