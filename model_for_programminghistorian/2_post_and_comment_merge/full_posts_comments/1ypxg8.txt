*The Diary of King Belasko II as written by /u/Kamikyu*

**1016, 6, 6 - The coronation.** 

[Diganty. Honor. Fatherhood. That was all that life meant to me. Then my own father died. And next thing I knew, I was king.] (http://i.imgur.com/JbVheMf.png)    
I kneeled on a marble platform in Beni Yani, or New Zeruko. [The town was small for being a capital.] (http://i.imgur.com/8YzWox6.jpg) Probably why I liked it. Drops of sweat bathed me as the metal circlet was placed on my head. It was cold. Not warm like I always imagined.    
There was no speech.    
There was no great cheer.    
There was only silence. As a Basque culture, the descendants of my Great Grandmothers rag-tag band of refugees were serious as always. I sent out two carrier pigeons, across the great waters. One was for the body of my father to be shipped here, for a formal funeral. My father, Belasko the first had always suffered with what his doctors called “Pulmonary” disorders. I could only assume that one of them was what killed him.

Second of all I ordered the troops to continue the war. War was a bloody thing. I hate pbloody things. But it was a necessity, at times. But what do I know of necessity? I am but a simple ruler - cursed by having to rule. This crown is far too tight on my head. I hope that what comes next will be...easy. But Allah knows I am delusional to think that I am to have no challenges.

**The rest of 1016, the year of war.**


 If you bother to read my Journal, my children, excuse the previous page which I have scribbled out. The first year of my reign was not only stressful, but bloody. First order of business - end my Father’s war.

***

**Spring and Summer** 

Why he started it, I am not sure. Does it matter? Men have died, and more men will die. [My job is to make sure it is more of them that die, not us.] (http://i.imgur.com/IZhKMUN.png) A simple task may it be. The siege shall continue.
Emotions are dulled by distance. Across the Sea, I can not help but wonder how my ancestors felt as they ordered men to die in Iberia. At least my father fought in battle. I would do the same, but, I have business to attend to. I must listen to the bewailing widows, and the sychophants DAY in and DAY OUT. It is fustrating. I play  jeu de paume  with my sisters to relax. And meanwhile men die.

I take strolls from time to time, in the hilly city streets. A coin for a beggar, or a visit to a local merchant. Anything to ease the pain of my people. It is what Allah wills, and what my legendary ancestor, Anderkina would of done. My cultural cousins of Andalusia must wonder what strange custom it is to live across the sea. Owning half of Cantabaria, my subjects seem torn in culture.

Bah. Culture. I live as a human - as all men do. Islam, Catholocism, Orthadoxy, The Cathar, The Yazidi who worship Shaytan. All men exist equally.    

But more often than not, all men die equally.

***

**Fall and Winter**

The year progresses. Fighting is light, but intense. Acute strikes against  scattered armies happens often, as we beat down the enemy. [But best of all, they fight amongst one another.] (http://i.imgur.com/Y0SqUNT.png) Good, I say! It saves my men lives. Or so it did. I cry for my people day in, and day out. Why must we suffer on this earth? But take heart, the way is almost won. We are soon to be the owners of Barcelona.

Or so I thought when I wrote this. Travesty and tragesty! Allah threw away our lives for nothing! At least now the widows menfolk sleep in Paradise! Law!? You call this LAW!? I dressed in rags and went to the highest tower of the castle to commune with the Greatest. The war is over do to some technicality. Lives thrown away! Lives lost! [And all we got out of it was the satisfaction of burning down five cities, and capturing the wife of ONE general.] (http://i.imgur.com/CFYtgmf.png) 
What sin did we do? What travesty have we committed? Why did I inherit this kingdom!? To rule our men, JUST to lose hundreds of lives, and then it all be for NOTHING do to some LEGAL transaction!? My children WILL rule a brighter country, I swear on the Qu’ran, I swear on the Prophets, I swear TO ALLAH. [And to do this? We need allies.] (http://i.imgur.com/WStUPat.png)
My oldest daughter is a brat, but oh my soul, I love her. I intended to marry her off to a descendant of Muhammad, PBUH, and the heir to a great Sultanate. [He, or atleast his guardian, accepted without question.] (http://i.imgur.com/WStUPat.png) This sacred bethrothal means only one thing - Allah favors us to have a strong alliance.

Allah favours us, and now I shall show to Allah, that we favor him. Ramadan! My belly weakened, and my bowels ceased to function, but by God, I proved to the Greatest, that he is MY Greatest. [Now, for the feast! This is a break, and a celebration.] (http://i.imgur.com/fmqDKXw.png)

***


**1017, 1, 28, - For my children, I do many things.**

This entry follows Ramadan, and is written by a troubled man. I am that man. Did I really, just sell out my oldest child for extra soldiers in war? Is that what I really did? Did Allah even speak to me? I have thought on this for hours, locked away in my room. Non-Al-Andalus Europa is a challenge to my very existence. Italy, Francia, and Provence all stick out as threats to me, and my children. For my children, I must secure a European holding out side of Al-Andalus. [I have chose Aquitaine, our old Allies, who back stabbed us and broke their alliance with us when we  became muslim.] (http://i.imgur.com/D0hgfel.png) 
This time, I will fight myself. I will kill. I will spill blood. I am a good father, and not only will my heir be healthy physically, but spiritually healthy, and honored and revered by all men. So I declared Jihad. Jihad for the Aquitanian-Toulouse duchies. This will give us power in the Trade Leagues, and a foot hold on Europe. As my Great, Great, Grandmother, Elida said, “Deus Vult!” I can not help but oblige the favor on our northern neighbors, who oppress my childrens legacy.

***

**1017’s Spring - War and Reality.**

 I fought in my father’s wars more than once, and still, today, I say, armor fits me much better than a crown! Gold and tan laced over with a robe, also gold and tan, I looked like a desert lion, riding proudly on my Horse. The horses that Elida brought with her had been bred thoroughly. And speaking of breeding, Allah pardon my uncouth manner,  my wives all bid me farewell. As I sail across the sea, I ponder upon my wives, who in the past I looked at as children and alliance makers. Maryam is my love, I do believe. She did not kiss me raunchily, or offer to come to my bed chamber before I left for Andalus. She embraced me tenderly, and whispered comforting words in my ear, and how Allah loved me. She is my [love] (http://i.imgur.com/TfPChj0.png) when my world is full of hatred. 

Six Thousand strong we were before tragedy and treachery befell us! The pass between Aquitaine and Navarre is where we planned to meet in battle, before one by one destroying the honorless basque french. Then they came. They came to sow discord, rape our women, and loot our banking system. The NORSE DOGS fell upon us. A rebel from the noble house of Yngling who was our physical rival in the Ire-land,  had come raiding us, wanting blood and gold. Cutting off a thousand of our men, and killing them [in just a few months times.] (http://i.imgur.com/Xga6WNo.png) The Aquitainian Basque approach us, no more then a hundred in number greater than us. We were shattered by this small difference and sent running for the coast of Barcelona. 

Vindication is mine, no Angel or Man would oppose my righteous indignation. [Those who are responsible, would reap.]  (http://i.imgur.com/kqBHAIo.png) And now what he had [sown] (http://i.imgur.com/ynmsTq9.png) was [fruitful] (http://i.imgur.com/J2giXIH.png) ...For us.

While we regrouped from Barcelona, sadly, more men fell into the remaining Norsemen’s [trap] (http://i.imgur.com/clMi4aX.png) .

I myself, was forced to go back to North Africa, for the sake of [crushing an aquitanian noble who had a holding in my capital.] (http://i.imgur.com/gPVbTk2.png) No doubt this was not Luck, but Allah’s working, to bring my back to Africa. We had many troops to resupply us that day.

***

**1017, through the end of the year.**

 What type of inoiz [[A word with many meanings, but one of which is “Shitty.”]] [war IS this, exactly?] (http://i.imgur.com/oQNILIF.png) I toil for MONTHS to invade my OWN capital, as men around me die every day. EVERY day. Meanwhile, thanks to the norse animals, our main force must guard a pass, instead of invading. Even while I write this, arrows bombarded the siege camp. [I called this war in the name of Allah, and now others come in the name of the Christian version of the Greatest. And now I suffer for the Greatest.] (http://i.imgur.com/n3JMnrp.png) Wessex has attacked our seige camp. They snuck up behind us in the night, and went tent to tent, killing us. Luckily, one of the men was committing sodomy with another man, funny how the Greatest works, and was awake when they came to his camp. Screaming, the entire camp was awoke in minutes. Organizing a defence line, we quickly rallied the main force, and retreated, but not with losing so many good men. It got worse. Our [Irish] (http://i.imgur.com/OrX7ew1.png) nieghbors came to kill even more good men. [The norse have been driven off, valiantly however.] (http://i.imgur.com/USUALU1.png)

So much war…..for the sake of my children. Am I delusional to think that this helps them!? Even my young son mocks me. 
This war has brought much misery. What could go worse?


**1018, March 16-19th. Why did I have to open my big mouth…?**

After hiring african mercenaries to systematically destroy the Anglo invaders, I finally had my city back. I was given a hero’s welcome. But where was my one true lover? Where was my beloved first wife? Miryam? She must of been mothering my children, as she was good at. The marble steps of New Zeruko were much more comfortable than the sands of the siege camp. I am not a man for speeches, but my generals pressured me to give a small speech. I assured them that if we can beat the Anglish, the Norse, we can surely conquer the french coast land. Going to the open air court room that my ancestors had sat on for ages - well, except for that Elida, who thougth she was Carthage with larger mammaries. Then again, she founded this city as well….ENOUGH of my idle musing.

I was greeted by my straight faced daughter. “Darling child, where is your mischievous smile?” is what I said. I remember those words. She ran off crying. Then I saw the open casket. [Oh...I….] (http://i.imgur.com/3IwxD6r.png) still….can barely write about it, but what happened next was worse. Tayyurt stepped from the white bleached corner of the court smiling. She was my new first wife. Asking the entire court to clear, I stayed the night near the casket, in holy communion to Allah. And the next. On the morning of Thursday, my close friend and marshal, Anzar dared to break the silence. Him and a small cadre of guards entered, with Tayyurt. [“My lord…….I never had time to tell you...it was poisoning. We found the vial, and Tayyurt bragged about the foul deed to me this morning.”] (http://i.imgur.com/WUR0Yni.png) That was the simple verdict.

Allah, Greatest, Lord of Lords, Chief of the Heavenly Host, Highest! Forgive me!
Anzar presented me a small vial, half full of the poison which had killed my beloved. My mind was racing. I put the vial to my own lips for a half second, then stopped the selfish suicide I considered. No. I had more to do on this earth. I had to secure an empire for my children.

What happened next, gave me nightmares tonight. Like an animal, I jumped on Tayyurt, pinning down both her arms, and forcing the neck of the bottle down her throat, [violently](http://i.imgur.com/YMrz3C2.png). 

I still don’t care if it was the poison or my own hands that killed her. Only by Allah’s forgiveness did I let go of my anger. I write this, in a cold sweat in the early morn of twentieth. I intend to have her body quartered and her limbs sent back to the Idrisid Sultanate, whom I curse this day. Her head and torso are to be hanged in the entrance of my court.
People need a reminder of justice.

***

**1018, May 23, Forgive the silence.** 

Dear descendants, and historians that read this, sorry for the silence. I am busy dealing with the Six thousand men encamped outside the city. Meanwhile, things go [smoothly in france.] (http://i.imgur.com/rvwJwWF.png)

***

**1018, July 18, I’m out of here.**

I have decided to join my main army in Al-Andalus, in battle. A bloody escape from New Zeruko had left me and close to two thousand men scrambling to our Armada, and sailing for the main land. [Wish me luck.] (http://i.imgur.com/lXaIG9D.png)

***

**1018, December 29, my eyes.** 

I can not believe it. Brittany. The Bretons allied themselves with Aquitaine. Since my last update, we had conquered ALL of Narbonne, and Saisacc. Then a small force of Bretons attacked us. Filthy Kaffir!  Four thousand of them almost entirely destroyed our superior army of Six thousand. The third battle commences as I write this. To the battleline, I must go. [To the hell-hole, I must charge] (http://i.imgur.com/hYPQHXQ.png) 

***

**1020, March 30.**  

[Today, I found my journal. I lost it while on a march through the desert. Found it finally, a year later. I have killed many men myself, since the last I have wrote.](http://i.imgur.com/0fVcC8a.png) My marriage of my daughter to anotehr man to make an Alliance, has finally, I repeat, finally, bore fruit. We only hang on this long, because the filthy French Basque men have no mercy

***


**1020-22, End of War...for one month.**

 I must write in brief what happened. I am mustering the army as I dictate this to my calligrapher.  The Hospitaliers came in the tens of thousands [or so it would seem,] (http://i.imgur.com/e0mORYF.png), and butchered  more than seventy of our holdings. I sailed from my refuge in Africa, after I had personally participated in battle for one year straight, I had to rest; to Al-Andalus. I signed my treaty personally, in the company of six army leaders, in the border.

Then one month later, on the same day, bad news came. [Bad news.] (http://i.imgur.com/3MwUAvz.png)

To keep face, I must answer the call to our Allies war. To keep my children’s land, I must wage war against the rebels. GREATEST, I PRAY that I do YOUR  will in this.

Then my son and law, who is coincidentally, my...tenth cousin, declared war on me. [Yeah, I am SO suited to be king.] (http://i.imgur.com/PVl09OM.png) I wonder now, if my Children will rule a country, or a little city state. 

Salvation from within - a side note added post mortem by the council - King Belasko the Kind had won the heart many people. He treated prisoners with courtesy, he released tehm, and he forgave his enemies. This had made him [popular] (http://i.imgur.com/u9wS3Yi.png) and helped win the campaign in north africa.

***

**1025 - Fueling my rage.** 

This year, I encountered three more wars. I say encountered lightly. Most of them were invasions, but one was a revolt...I finally secured my contract with the Bektashi, who are bound for the Ire-land and are currently battling the enemy. Sadly…[My joy died.]  (http://i.imgur.com/Uyv0xNm.png) It is hard to explain how much I HATED my son for dying. I did EVERYTHING FOR him. I did this to secure him an empire. And now he is dead. The healers say it is because of the curse of Nefferako; the weakness of our bodies which has plagued us since Anderkina, a weakness in the body. [On the other hand, the Bektashi served JUSTICE for me.] (http://i.imgur.com/vAfzhwg.png) And now my enemies army and holdings lay burning. My mother, whom I never knew well, died this year as well.

***



**1031, January 17- end of the bloody decade.**  There is so much I have missed, not keeping up with my journal. (((Out of character note: I DID record all of this with screen shots, but if I was to record all of 1021 - 1031, this would qualify as a short novella, something I doubt you would want to read.))) Today, I signed the last peace treaties.
All my foes have been trumped, trumped me, or I have allowed to escape. 

To fill in all descendants of mine, several things happened. Oxtoa, my son, was caught planning the mass murder of my family line, to secure a place on the throne. I exiled him to Viscaya. Now he lives with those like him - traitors. 

I have fathered many more children, and have married a beautiful Mande woman.

I am the adopted father of this [rascal] (http://i.imgur.com/ZPB79Fp.png) whose father died fighting for me in the wars. She has took after me, and is to be married to one of my sons, Greatest willing.

Most important of all, I have founded a steady empire for my children to rule!


As much as I hate to sound like a pompous dick, I am rather proud of this write up. IT is short, but I spent a whole day planning it.
Hope you all have fun reading!
