Please recommend a good noob coop vanilla ck2 please!

I think me and my nephew would enjoy raping the world together.

I was thinking we could share noob Ireland then we could help the other one take Scotland or something?

If you are very new noob island is the best. Just have a jouse rule that the first one to make duke will gets to be boss and the other will be the strongest subject. 

Maybe a Jerusalem and Sicily game?  Might even be fun trying start as Vassals of the Arabian Empire.

Oh crap, I just noticed you said no DLC. Otherwise I'd suggest Ã˜stlandet + Bohemia comp-stomp.

Maybe try being counts inside of one of the Frankish realms? It's pretty fun to be count. (But good to be king)
