Frisia nerf? When did this happen?

So playing one province Visby to form a republic soonish, figured Frisia and even more so, Brugge would be awesome to have for this. 

Prepared invasion, all is well the French king is getting raped by my ally ragnar lodbrok and me. Then I notice something awful. Frisia is damn small now. Check wiki about this, maybe I just gained the Imbecile trait, and now I'm forgetting shit. Wiki confirms my suspicion Frisia got shadownerfed(it used to include flanders and brabant, now those belong to france and lotharingia respectively), or atleast for me since I don't follow every single patch.

Even losing brabant would be a big hit for such a small kingdom, but taking both makes some duchies better than this "kingdom". It used to be awesome, even competing with bigger kingdoms because of it's wealth and now it's crap tier. Only the spanish kingdoms seem smaller and weaker now.

So form the kingdom and wait for the time to strike for the other holdings you want, then hang onto them and make it de jure. I mean I see how it makes it harder. You could probably open the game file to check what counties belong to what duchies and edit those to counties back to Frisia. If your able to figure that out you could save it separately as a mod, even upload it to steam.

It happened before I got into the game, but you should do it anyways, since there's also a new achievement to give frisia back its dejure borders ("good old times", i think, so yeah, it's probably been some time?)

Think it happened with the Reaper's Due update. Before then, the HRE had de jure claims on Flanders and would spent the first few decades of the game at war with France.
