The new combat system does not work...

The new combat system does not work in favour of smaller kingdoms like it was planned because the more troops the enemy has the faster the flank falls and the dmg bonus is (probably historically accurate not sure) is To much. I saw Cummania not loose more then 100 men in 10k vs 7k. I managed to drag down the levy of cummania down to 7k and then hired mercs so I was at about 4,5k men and they had major river crossing penalty and then they  lost about 800 men while my army was obliterated.

They also need to rebalance these revolts while playing under France I saw Lothringa get a liberation revolt which had 16k men while the max levy of lothringa was 5k. And they did not disband after they raped Lothringa so a 4 county kingdom was almost as strong as the Shia caliphate that controlled arabia,mesopotamia and almost all of persia and this is rich land btw. 

Then there are religous peasant revolts that are 3 times as big as your levy at full and you are then loosing 5% moral authority and 500 prestige and 500 piety YAY.

Have you appointed army leaders? Not having any makes a big difference in close battles. Also, I agree. Peasant revolts are incredibly OP right now. Your only chance is to build up a big retinue force and use them as a sort of fire fighting brigade.
