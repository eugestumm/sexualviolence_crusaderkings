Is raiding OP?

Hello fellow incestual, kinsmutilating internet sword wielding psychopaths.

I have a question for you.

I am currently playing Poland (Charlemange start as Greater Poland) and after a while I managed to finally form the kingdom of Poland (basically just kicked other polish duches asses and vassalised them).

After that I took my tribal principality for a spin, raiding and looting till I finally got enough money and piety to call myself a king. All was fine with the world.

And than, when I was conquering further and further reaches of eastern europe I noticed something. Raiding is OP. I took marshall troops, added my military force from mobilization and had some fun in Lithuania (country around 1,5 size of mine). By fun I do mean of course rape their entire countryside, and slaughter all and any troops that they thought of sending to their "glorious conquest of pommerania". After finishing last straggler I took my boys home, demobilized, declared war, mobilized again (added the 2500 troops for 500 prestige from tribal army event), invaded their still burning villages, and before you know it Lithuanian king now holds around 1/3 of what he had in the begining.

In the end isn't it a bit cheesy? I mean he can't retaliate (if I see that he has more troops than I do, I can simply retreat and raid some other neighbour), I have nothing to lose (his troops won't touch my countryside) and in the end combined with some basic intrigue, and dissent spreading I can topple any empire I so desire.
Nevermind even the 500 prestige penalty for those 2500 soldiers, after one conquest I make it back with profit. And if I get a local conflict (bishop rebelled) I can bring those guys for a full raiding rodeo, without the silly "has to be at war" requirement.

TL;DR Raiding as a pre-invasion crippling strike, op or not? Have I broken the system or what?

Raiding is love, I usually start at 769 just to have more tribal areas and more places to run, and poland is amazing because there's a Pomerania north of you with cities and bishoprics

Shhhh raiding is the best thing ever ever ever and should never be broken... seriously... I'm a fan.

Just wait until someone with nothing but heavy troops and cavalry shows up with almost as many troops.

500 prestige armies? Amateur, those have upkeep. Keep a war going and your *free* event troops from Build Legend will accumulate and spawn in ever-increasing size stacks, up to 3x3000 soldiers. And just like any event troop, they can raid. Have a war with some eastern dirt-poor OPM and use the troops to loot the West.

Yes, raiding is OP and I'll tell you why I think so. 

**Stage 1:** Imagine you're a count in Tribal Ireland. You set your marshall to raising a raiding party and eventually he does. You then raise all your troops along side it so you have say 600 troops. You run around raiding every one of the counties adjacent to yours so you get a cut of everything (choosing a county with lots of bordering counties helps here) and because you're always stealing their gold they never get a chance to upgrade anything whereas you're getting gold and prestige from all the raids. 

**Stage 2:** Eventually (you'll probably need to lower and then raise your levy again to make sure it's at full power) your county is upgraded to the point that as well as raiding the counties in Ireland you also siege them. Now you can raid the counties which aren't bordering yours and still get gold from it. Raid everything constantly, make a fortune, upgrade more.

**Stage 3:** Declare a subjugation war on a county that belongs to the duchy your county belongs to. So if you started in Dublin you raid Cail Dara because they're both de jure Meath. Remember, you've raided these guys constantly until their village is in flames so they can't raise any troops. You win easily. Now you have two counties within the same duchy. Make the duchy for a 50% bonus to troops in your capital and a 25% bonus in the other county plus all the other benefits. Rinse and repeat until you're the King of Ireland. Then turn your greedy eyes toward Britain.

Doing things this way it's very easy to become the most powerful man in Ireland very quickly. I've also done this in Scandinavia. Because of the sheer size of the place it was a little slower going but it worked eventually.
