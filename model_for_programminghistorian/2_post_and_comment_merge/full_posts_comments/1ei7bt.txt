**14 September 1066**

I enter [the Black Chamber](http://www.kcn.ru/tat_en/history/images/oldtower.jpg), the legislature of my people, dragging my predecessor behind me in chains. Dirt, grime, and pebbles from the ground outside have lodged themselves in his wounds. On either side of me march proudly the courtiers and noblemen who plotted to install me in my rightful place.

The chamber floor is square, with rows of benches on either side of the throne. Afternoon sunlight streams through the stained glass windows of the dome and sparkles on the abstract mosaics along the chamber walls. My chained captive leaves a wide smear of blood and tears on the well-polished floor as I drag him behind me. The assemblymen murmur among themselves, their eyes falling on their she-dog of a former ruler. I speak.

"Assemblymen, welcome. I have patiently awaited this day. You will see that many seats within this chamber sit empty; your brethren who resisted my rise to power are dead. Their lands are confiscated, their older sons are executed, and their widows, daughters, and younger sons will bring much pleasure to me and my men before they, too, are killed.

"Although I will not tolerate treason during my reign, I will endeavor to be a just and honest monarch. And so long as you obey my commands, I will content myself with cruelty against our enemies. Give me your loyalty and I will build up a fortune for the Bulgarians of the Volga not seen since our ancestors swept across the steppe with the armies of Attila."

The assemblymen are gazing at their feet. Their expressions are far away. One by one, their eyes turn to look upon me. Shaking his head at their timidity, my newly-appointed steward, Mayor Uzluk of Suar, rises from his seat and claps loudly. Like deer bolting from a copse, the rest of the assembly rises in imitation. Some feign joyful weeping; others give forced cheers and praises.

I am [Ishanadl, Duke of the Bulgars of the Volga](http://i.imgur.com/0J1E1Ve.jpg). Beware.

[**15 September 1066**](http://i.imgur.com/pQ2Kfx1h.jpg)

A messenger arrives from the court of Biyar, [High Chief of the Mordvins](http://i.imgur.com/Wqc9fCX.jpg).

"Your highness, sovereign Duke of the Volga Bulgarians, lately sending couriers into our land, the Cheremisa, did claim certain villages and strongholds, in right of your great predecessor, Attila the Hun. In answer of which claim, the High Chief my master says that you savour too much of your youth, and bids you satisfy yourself with the shores of the confluence of the Volga, as befits your contented nature. He therefore sends you, as more appropriate for your youthful spirit, this chest of mighty treasure; and in lieu of this, desires to hear no more of you. This the High Chief speaks."

I gesture to my stewards, Mayor Uzluk, to examine the contents of the small chest borne by the messenger.

"What treasure, steward?"

Uzluk peers into the chest, frowning. He appears hesitant.

"...ankle bone dice, my liege, [with which to play Asik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shagai)."

I drum my fingers against the arm of my throne. My head tilts back, and I gaze at the domed roof above me in contemplation. The assembly sits silent, their eyes fixed on me or on the tremulous messenger. At last, I speak.

"We are glad that your High Chief is so pleasant with us. We thank you for his present. And when we have roused our retainers, we will, in the Cheremisa, by God's grace, play a game with him. Tell your master that I will crush him; I will see him and his people driven before me; and I will listen with delight to the lamentation of his women. Go in peace, and tell him. Go!"

As the messenger departs, I summon my riders into the chamber. Scribes hurriedly pen my shouted orders.

"Call up the troops! I want two thousand men assembled in Bulgar by the end of the month!"

**17 December, 1066 - 14 January 1067**

The godless horde of High Chief Biyar surround [the walls of Bulgar](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Bolgar.JPG) in a foolhardy siege. Hearing the roar of our hooves, the Suomenusko devils flee to [the fields of Ashli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aşlı), where we overtake them. I myself lead the vanguard and delight in the slaughter of over a thousand worthless pagans. Routed, Biyar and his personal guard flee back to the safety of the Mordvin patrimony. The Battle of Ashli is a great victory; that we outnumbered our foe two to one is of no consequence.

***

**17 January 1067**

As we march west into the heart of Mordvin territory we are intercepted by a courier from the capital. I am informed that Pyera, [High Chief of Perm](http://i.imgur.com/mdBcVRs.jpg), has invaded the northern reaches of our patrimony to press his claim to the valley of Votyaki. [The Mordvins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordvins) are weak and spineless; the armies of Perm are not. I must force a northward march to deal with Pyera before returning south to complete my conquest of the Cheremisa.

***

**26 April - 5 August 1067**

Our forces clash with High Chief Pyera at the Battle of Sarana in Votyaki. Our forces are evenly mached, with no more than fifteen hundred men to a side. Although there is no great slaughter, the battle is a tactical victory. We pursue Pyera's host east to the very gates of [Perym, their capital](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Sergei_Mikhailovich_Prokudin-Gorskii_-_City_of_Perm._General_view_%281910%29.jpg)! Pyera's troops are driven against their walls and impaled. Alas, Pyera and his personal retainers escaped through a secret tunnel back into the city. Rather than lay siege to the pagan citadel, I lead my troops south to complete our destruction of the Mordvins.

***

**26 October 1067**

My men toast to my health as news reaches the camp that my First Wife, Ipekel, has given birth to a son! My dutiful wife has named him Ishanadl in my honour. Some day, God willing, all that I rule now will belong to him and his heirs in perpetuity.

***

**6 November 1070**

Victory! I lay waste to the Mordvins and delight in the personal torture and execution of their priests and noblemen. Biyar, his wife and two daughters in tow, flees to Perym. I later learn that my other foe, Pyera, takes them into his care at Perym. I divide the Cheremisa among various courtiers - contented, quiet stewards who will obey me for the foreseeable future - and return to Bulgar in triumph.

***

[**20 December 1070 - 19 September 1071**](http://i.imgur.com/rdq6Ngjh.jpg)

[Chief Tugan of Kerzhenets](http://i.imgur.com/KgOdzUz.jpg), one of my few pagan vassals, is scandalized by my treatment of the Mordvins. He demands I grant him independence! The fool! My harsh treatment is justified. They're barely human!

My forces were ready to depart Bulgar for Perym anyway. At the Battle of Zäy we crush Tugan's forces and [sack his citadel at Qazan](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Kazan_cityscape.jpg). My troops lay siege to the fortified villages and temples that surround the citadel, looting and raping as they go.

***

**13 November 1071**

A courier arrives from Bulgar with more troubling news: Begluk, [the High Chief of Tyumen](http://i.imgur.com/7v4v5fT.jpg) - a vassal of the Khan of Cumania - has invaded our patrimony over his claim to one of our counties! I order a small detachment to march north to continue the fight against the pagans of Perm, headed by my faithful steward, Uzluk, while the bulk of my forces prepares to march south to meet the Tyumen host.

***

**7 March 1072**

I find Chief Tugan, the snivelling lord of Kerzhenets, hiding in the cellar of a freshly-sacked temple. His wife and two sons cower there beside him. After a tumble with his wife, and another with one of his sons (I can't remember which, really), I cut off his thumbs and throw him in prison. He'll stay there till he rots, no matter how many times he begs for more suitable accomodations! I strip him of his title and grant it to one of my loyal followers.

As I bathe at camp that evening, news reaches me regarding the Khan of Cumania and his vassals, the High Chiefs of Tyumen and Aktobe. Apparently [the two of them have freed themselves from the Khan's yoke](http://i.imgur.com/UnkELEY.jpg) and now rule as independent lords. Willfully cut off from the assistance of his former Khan, the High Chief of Tyumen may be easier to repel than I had first assumed...

***

**8 - 21 January 1073**

The Battle of Belebey is as brief as it is decisive. Don't these idiot nomads know how to fight? My forces, numbering over twenty-four hundred, caught a mere one thousand troops drunk on wine after sacking one of my vassal's holdings. They were an easy target and died quickly.

***

**25 December 1073**

Word reaches me that my steward, Uzyuk, has successfully sacked the capital city of Perym in the lands of Perm. Surrounded by my soldiers with no avenue of escape, High Chief Pyera has accepted defeat. He will not press his claim further. Uzyuk's men in Perm march south to join the bulk of my forces as we sack the Cuman villages, temples, and citadels of Tyumen.

***

**13 September 1074**

[Tyumen has fallen](http://i.imgur.com/Z9mrWAI.jpg)! My troops have taken hold of the city. After the populace has been subdued and the city walls garrisoned with men under my command, I take it upon myself to inspect the tallest building in the city.

While peering out of one of the tower's windows, what should I see but the face of my own son and heir, Ishanadl, peeking back at me! The boy, who has accompanied me with his mother on my campaign in Tyumen, is about six years old now; it's high time I took him under my wing and educated him! Fatherly discipline will keep him from wandering off so foolishly. I seize him by the waist, pull him inside, and drop him on the floor of the tower.

"Ishanadl! What are you doing?"

"Exploring the walls, father. I'm curious about how they're made. They look very different from the walls we have in Bulgar."

"Oh, very well. If you can't be cautious, at least be smart about where you go wandering."

"Curiosity never killed anyone, father!"

"True. Go on, now. Be quick about it."

What a brave little boy.

**7 December 1074**

I have kept court at Tyumen for three months. I allow my generals to do my work for me; there are plenty of pagan nobles to torment here in the Tyumen capital.

Horns call out; my soldiers return en masse. On the battlements of Tyumen I see that my generals are accompanied by none other than the High Chief of Tyumen himself, the fiery-eyed Begluk.

"My lord!" calls a herald from below. "Begluk and your steward, Uzluk, have negotiated a peace settlement. He will end this war, and abandon his claim to our lands, if only we will restore his citadel to him."

We swear to peace at the gates of the city. My men withdraw, loot and captive women in tow in the wagons behind them. His city returned to him, Begluk and his retainers trot on horseback into Tyumen, their helds hung low with shame. My generals wish to return to Bulgar at once - we have been long far from home - but I beg them to stay. I tell them that I have a special surprise for them.

The men wait restlessly, chattering among themselves. Someone in the ranks cries out, pointing to the walls of Tyumen. Tendrils of black, oily smoke rise in thick curls from one of the quarters of the city. Suddenly, there is a deep and powerful explosion. The ground vibrates beneath my feet, and a section of Tyumen's city walls collapses. Uzluk turns to me, agape. His expression makes me laugh.

"Don't look so surprised, Uzluk. You don't think I'd give up the city without having a little fun first? I set fire to stores of manure I hid across the city. Begluk can keep his little castle.. what's left of it, at least."

I signal for the men to march. We turn to the northwest, to home. As we depart, I see Begluk on the battlements, screaming curses at me through a brass speaking trumpet.

Weeks later, when my men and I arrive in Bulgar, the people welcome us with a great festival and parade. While making a speech in the city square at the end of the evening's banquet, I formally crown myself as Duke of Cheremisa. The Cheremisa belongs to the Mordvins no more; I must adopt this title to secure my legal right to the territory.

***

[**21 April 1075 - 30 March 1076**](http://i.imgur.com/2V4fxAmh.jpg)

Rule from Bulgar bores me. I am only content so long as I have pagans to torture; regrettably, the few I had on hand in my dungeon have all perished from blood loss or illness. I need new victims!

An opportunity presents itself during a session in the Black Chamber. The assemblymen agree: our noblemen have been at home for too long. They are accustomed to the life of war and blood lust that I have provided. They yearn to bring the word of God to more of the heathen lands that surround us.

"The weakest of our pagan neighbours is Sarin, [High Chief of the Samoyeds](http://i.imgur.com/TW2G318.jpg), my lord," an assemblyman shouts. "If it please your grace, we should march our men north to subdue them, to drive them from their lands, and to subjugate them beneath our heels. And, of course, if your grace wishes to administer those new lands effectively, I am certain that members of this assembly would gladly take stewardship of the lands on your behalf."

Typical. Lesser nobles always scrabble for more. It is to my advantage to conquer pagan lands, however, and our forces are indeed mighty...

"Very well," I intone. "Uzluk, go with the Marshal. Send word to the militia men. Let them know there will be more women and wealth for them in very short order."

"Yes, my liege!"

Within days, our forces - twenty-five hundred strong - have gathered in the north of our realm. Fording a stream, we are surprised by the host of the Samoyeds with Sarin at its head. The Battle of Kungur is a Bulgarian victory; Sarin's forces, inexperienced against mounted troops, flee in disarray. Regrouping hurriedly on a low, distant hill, Sarin's men escape to the north.

My men and I follow behind Sarin's forces, rushing stragglers as we go. We march north - far north - to the very edge of the world. To my knowledge, [no Bulgarians from the Volga have ever seen such a place](http://russiatrek.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/the-white-sea-nature-russia-1.jpg).

The ground is cold and hard. It is covered in thin tufts of short grasses, mosses, and lichens. There are no trees to speak of, no birds, no visible animals. In this respect it is very much like the steppes that lie to the east, or to the open fields and plains within my patrimony. But there is water - a great water - a big water - stretching to the very horizon and in every direction. Large, thick sheets of white ice float slowly on the water's surface. I knew that a great water existed to the north of our lands, but I had no idea it was so impressive. The works of God are truly wondrous.

In the distant north I lose track of Sarin and his men. They have melted away into the grass and snow. Far from home and low on supplies, my men are forced to turn back. Marching south, we encounter a band of Samoyed troops. After entertaining myself with a few disembowelments, I learn from one of the warriors that Sarin has regrouped his forces and is marching south for his capital.

A lookout sights Sarin's host [near Veliky Ustug](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Veliky_Ustug.jpg), tired and weak from our long pursuit. We, too, are tired and weak, but God is on our side. In a long and arduous battle I am victorious! Sarin and his retainers are nowhere to be found, however. No matter; I will sack his villages and citadels until he is found.

My men lay siege to Verkh Mgla, the Samoyed capital. I will hold court here with my heir and First Wife until my generals have subdued the Samoyeds completely.

Really well written, idk how anyone is going to follow a write-up like that. My *only* hangup, and, this may just be me, it's that there wasn't hardly any actual screenshots from the game, so while it was a really good story I struggled to relate it to how things went in the actual game. I had no idea the extent of the conquests or how many kids Ishanadl had until I looked at the realm map and obituary picture, respectively.

Needs more maps!

Nice write-up, but I think there was all of one map to give context as to where we are and where we conquered. Was a bit hard to follow in that sense.

Also, and this is a nitpick, but is this a journal? A livelog? A history looking back? A narrative? I'm confused by the word choice and tense -- it's written as if by a Christian ruler ("lords" "monarch") and doesn't feel particularly Islamic to me. But maybe that's what the Volga Bulgars were like?

/u/PrivateMajor , please add these images to these dates in the write-up:

Geez, /u/ursa-minor-88 You haven't set the bar high or anything.... ;)

The Blobbing Begins.

Great start! Also interesting that you mixed some non CKII screenshots in there to help give a more real world context. 

An interesting choice. I'm excited to see how this plays out!

This write up is beautifully done and well written. I found myself heavily engaged into the story as Ishanadl completed conquest after conquest. /u/ursa-minor-88 set the bar high with a wonderful epic and I hope that the future writers continue to create a wonderful tapestry of successful Khans. I hope that the good fortune of Allah and the Prophet continues to shine upon the dynasty of Ishanadl. THe only compliant I have to this amazing write up is that more maps of the actual world need to be included. I did enjoy how ursa used real life pictures to show the readers where his story coincided with our real world. Thank you uras and privatemajor, I looked forward to more succession stories!

ursa-minor-88, I'm very quickly growing to love your writeup style. It's not just that they're so full and detailed, it's the flavor you throw into them. The real-life pictures of places where you battle/rule from, the subtle ways you work in children gaining traits, and the mini-narratives you insert in really add to the immersion of the story. King Serlo was my favorite writeup last round because of the whole "Maison de Souris" bit.

I know some of the others feel a bit pressured to follow in your footsteps, but I really hope you keep doing AARs like this, especially in future succession games. You've got a real talent for it.

Excellent writing and map painting. I like the Henry V reference.
