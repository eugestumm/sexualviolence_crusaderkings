Oi me bum

So I was having a great game as Byzantium, mended the schism, had Italian ambitions on the way to restoring rome... forgot about the Seljuks... >_< They march in, wave their event troop dong in may face, catch my armies divided, rape my retinue out of existence, and take all of syria away from me. Out of rage I assassinated his entire male line. They only had half their full force but it was still greater than mine because of the loss if retinue. Invade me again and there isn't much I can do to stop it... I was sooooo close to Rome and now I will probably have to start over... Any advice on how to recover from my mess? Or more likely deal with it next time?

TL;DR: QQ, Seljuks r mean

Expand in the opposite directions. Seljuks can't stop you from going north or west. Take them lands, rebuild your retinues and wait until the latest possible minute to hit back. They won't have those event troops forever. If you can get them to waste those troops through assaults or stupidity, all the better. You can sacrifice one kingdom if you're gaining two or three elsewhere.
