Bruh how the fuck do you even defend against a Crusade? Just got hit with a 60K-strong army. Seems like the best way to keep your lands is to simply surrender, save up your money, and just declare war on the beneficiary ruler after the truce is over...

Seems like its near-impossible to win against the Pope.I kept getting ass raped by the Pope's army blobs. Decided to save scum and  I used the AI strategy and went straight to Rome, captured the Pope, and it gave ZERO war score....what the fuck?! I decided to torture/execute the Pope and just surrender cuz no pojnt wasting time/money on an unwinnable war.

Crusades are powerful! Just like in real life, they will probably succeed. But then they have to defend what they took. Which, just like real life, they will probably struggle to do.

I think you have it right, just plan on taking out the resulting kingdom, unless it's a weak crusade and/or you have a lot of strong friends

Play the attrition game and send your troops to Rome immediately. This way you have great chance of capturing the Pope. In CKIII if the capital is taken and the ruler was not leading troops I think he is instantly captured. (Could be wrong about that)

I've never seen a crusade win on its own. Everytime the pope orders a crusader the AI will trickle in 1-3k blobs while the arabs sit in jeruselum with a 10-15k doomstack that slaughters them as soon as they land. The AI is not smart enough to group b4 landing. Like I've seen it where the christians have 30-40k men at the start to the arabs 10-15k and they still lose every single time unless I go myself and cheese with a huge amount of mercs.
