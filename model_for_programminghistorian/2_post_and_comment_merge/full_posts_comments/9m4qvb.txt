Got my first immortal character (650 hours) during an Aztec rape of my empire!



Well now you can live long enough to see the aztecs fall

R5: Got the event chain, being a hermit, I chose learning path. Got a kiddo, but she's got like 15 base learning. Passed the first test, passed the second, reincarnated on the third. Stupid W10 crashed one me :( /s Save scummed the third test, and passed it on second time. 

My second and third tests were in the middle of an Aztec invasion. They took Morocco, then declared war for Alban (Scotland). I ruled over Britain and Francia. I was using my entire army to just harass these asshole, dropping on them from my ships whenever I saw a lone regiment outside support range (I still lost, but hey, I killed 30K of their 200K).

On the bright side, the mystic is now my court doctor, and she's amazing, she converted to Cathar like me, and rarely ever fails a treatment.

So I've never had an immortal character, but wouldnt you just keep accruing prestige and piety and max long rule bonus and with a decent diplo score it seems like everyone in the world would want to be your friend.

You're an Emperor.. why'd you look like a Hermeticist? Kings and Emperors get their crowns.

FYI, being immortal doesn't protect you from getting your heart ripped out and sacrificed to the gods...
