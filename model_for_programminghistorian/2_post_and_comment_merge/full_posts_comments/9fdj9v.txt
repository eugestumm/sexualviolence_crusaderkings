Wow i put the game down for a year or 2 and its a whole new game!

I played around 500 hours of ck2, murdering, raping, pillaging, and marrying my way to european domination in ck2. Then i stopped around 2 years ago to do that in real life... realized real life sux so dropped $60 and bought all the dlc 2 days ago and fired up the ol' clausewitz engine. 

Kudos to paradox for continually keeping the game fresh. But now i have no clue wtf is going on. Why is China in Europe? Why do i need to hire a surgeon- all he did was cut my arms off and led to an early death. My councils a buncha assholes who never vote with me so im stuck dividing my kingdom amongst my useless sons (well to be honest i murder all but one every time... but its getting a little tiresome). 

Is there a succint guide out there that can bring someone up to speed on what changed in last few years? 

>Why is China in Europe?

Jade Dragon DLC

>My councils a buncha assholes who never vote with me so im stuck dividing my kingdom amongst my useless sons

Conclave DLC

>Why do i need to hire a surgeon- all he did was cut my arms off and led to an early death.

Reaper's Due DLC



Just wait till you see the Holy Fury DLC coming Soonâ„¢!

Each one of these is a separate DLC. Did you buy them without even reading what they add?

I'd suggest reading through all the dev diaries. Pretty much most of the information are there.

More intelligent surgeons are less likely to cut your arms off.

Managing your council gets easier later in your reign because of the long reign bonus. Once you go through a few generations, you'll accumulate other vassal management bonuses like books, artifacts, and Hermetic Society great works.

You are now in a FBI list
