Tyrannical to revoke title of a duchy I just conquered???

We’re vikings man. And we just raped, pillaged and plundered our way through the taking of a foreign duchy through blood and violence!

But if I then try to revoke the title of the heretical foreigner… Thats going too far and ill be seen as tyrannical!?!

THATS where the line is drawn!?!

Yeah, at first glance, it may seem weird. But, if you’re waging war against some foreign liege for land belonging to one of their vassals, you’re in effect warring for the “right” to be that vassal’s new liege. Your current vassals would view it as problematic that the new vassal’s title(s) could be stripped so easily. They’re thinking in simplistic terms: just that it’s bad news for any fellow vassal that any vassal’s land would be stripped.

A problem with bog-standard Vikings is that they're too religiously tolerant. It's that pesky Pluralist doctrine on Ásatrú.

If you were Righteous, you could revoke the titles of Evil heathens without penalty. If you were Fundamentalist, you could freely revoke Hostile heathens too. Often you can also imprison heathens, either for the crime of heresy itself or for refusing to convert after you've demanded it.

One thing that does cut in your favor is that you view adultery and fornication as criminal, even for men. You view practically *everything* as criminal, in fact, so you might be able to find some dirty secrets that disqualify your vassals from ruling.

Ultimately Vikings weren't especially interested in governing milk-drinkers. Consider reforming Ásatrú if you're built different.

Another alternative is to conquer land county-by-county. It's slower, but you never wind up with a vassal who costs tyranny to revoke. Varangian Adventures from Northern Lords will also expel everybody in the target duchy. Holy Wars don't work, again because of Pluralist.

I mean yeah you’re antagonizing your own people and nobles they’d absolutely view that as tyranny
