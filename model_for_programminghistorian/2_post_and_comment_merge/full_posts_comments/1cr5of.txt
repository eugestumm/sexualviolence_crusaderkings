[5 june 1229](http://i.imgur.com/wCyW4Lb.jpg)  

My father past away, leaving the realm in chaos and disarray.  
Many jackals and vultures have risen, who previously called themsleves my father's loyal vassal, but now lay claim to his titles.  
The foreigners from Pisa, seeing the chaos in our realm, send a peace offer for us to surrender, my regent and mother, the craven she is, immediately accepts.  
There is not much I can do at my current age to keep our realm together.  

***
[7 june 1229](http://i.imgur.com/rCJNiHD.jpg)  

My father left me with a sizeable sum of money.  
My mother thought it wise to spend it on barbarians from nubia to assist is in this war.  
Alas their upkeep would prove to be too much to maintain for more than a year.  

***
[15 july 1229](http://i.imgur.com/U6p0zcd.jpg)  

My mother send word to a distance relative of our troubles.  
It seems cowardice runs in your family, since he brazenly refused to honor our blood ties.  

***
[7 may 1230](http://i.imgur.com/7tbQqJ1.jpg)  

I spent today with my mother as she was meeing with the generals.
Observing the situation they realized they had to surrnder one war to win the other.  
After close observation, they decide to concede the Kingdom of Mesopotamia, a small part of my realm to a distant relative, the traitorous bastard.  

***
[18 may 1230](http://i.imgur.com/1fePMQi.jpg)

It was done. 
I am no longer the king of mesoptamia, lose on kingdom to save the other.  
My distant relative now calls himslef King-Bishop Henry IV of Mesopotamia, I'm sure he won't reign long.  
Now it's time to focus on the last remaining rebellion and restore order.  

***
[20 june 1230](http://i.imgur.com/Iq7c2Tf.jpg)

In a laughable twist of fate, the pretender now finds himself in trouble.  
He seems to be calling ME as his faithful ally!  
Naturally, my mother considered it unwise to heed his call, and we gracefully refused.  

***
[27 june 1230](http://i.imgur.com/koT1cbG.jpg)  

Just when we nearly finished with our wars, more vultures appear from the ashes.  
It appears they want the pretender, King Henry IV, on my rightful throne of syria.  
It seems our realm won't get to rest from the war after all.  

***
[25 july 1231](http://i.imgur.com/asjtnjB.jpg)  

My fourth nameday came and went.  
The realm is still in disarray, and I begin to wonder if my mother is a good regent.  
My first three years have been tumultuous, my father, may he rest in peace, did not leave me in an easy situation.  
He handed out many titles to members of the church, and decided it wise to tax them heavily.  
I almost don't blame them for rebelling, but such insolance must not be tolerated.  

***
[10 november 1231](http://i.imgur.com/oMgzLR1.jpg)  

My mother came to me today, the look of worry on her face.  
It seems my traiterous uncle is planning to murder me, and she insists I must be kept with a group of guards all day.  
I'm not allowed to go outside and play anymore.  
I don't like war.  

***
[26 march 1231](http://i.imgur.com/Mn1R8bt.jpg)  

Count Henry has been going aroound my realm with obviously forged documents, trying to make people recoginze his claim to my titles.  
I looks like we might have another war on our hands soon.  

***
[7 september 1232](http://i.imgur.com/Cqt2kCX.jpg)  

A messenger arived at court today.  
He immediately wanted to speak to mother.  
I listened in on the conversation and learned of shocking news.  
It appears that the barbarian mongol hordes to the east declare war upon us, no doubt to take advantage of our weakened state.  
They intend to take all the lands in the kingdom of mesopotamia, and no doubt burn their cities to the ground.  

***
[18 march 1233](http://i.imgur.com/pBzp5Wf.jpg)  

The mongols have arrive, and started their invasion in Tigris.  
They make short work of the relatively small garrison stationed there, and being looting and raping our subjects.  
Dirty barbarians.  

***
[27 july 1233](http://i.imgur.com/VJiBUSV.jpg)  

It was clear we stood no chance against the barbarian horde, so my mother wisely sued them for peace.  
We now lost control of any lands in the Kingdom of Mesopotamia, but better to lose one kingdom than lose everything.  
We'll come back for those barbarians when they least expect it.  

***
[29 may 1234](http://i.imgur.com/v1GulXI.jpg)  

A messenger of the rebels arrived today.  
I listened in on his conversation with mother.  
It seems their leader has come to his senses and wants to give up his foolish rebellion and recognize my rightful reign in Syria.  
Just one more rebel to take care off, it won't be long till we can breave a sigh of peace.  

***
[28 june 1234](http://i.imgur.com/Y7eWxfv.jpg)  

The traitor was brought before my mother today.  
He claims that, as a man of god, she has no right to imprison him.  
Naturally my mother disputed his foolish claims, and threw him back in the dungeon, lest he rebels again.

***
[4 december 1234](http://i.imgur.com/KXeRntB.jpg)  

I haven't been feeling well lately.  
The court doctor arrived and told me I should rest and I'm not allowed to leave the bed to go and play.  
Mother has been at my bedside for the last few hours, she doesn't want to show me, but I can see she looks worried.  

***
[19 march 1235](http://i.imgur.com/xUrM1Sc.jpg)  

I'm feeling much better again, and I'm allowed to go outside again!  
It would have been dreadful if I didn't recover from this illness, with the state our realm is currently in.  
I trust that mother will unite the realm soon.  

***
[4 may 1235](http://i.imgur.com/7DhQKw2.jpg)  

We recieved word that the barbarian hordes have looted and burned Baghdad.  
This is the capital of the pretender, Henry IV of Mesopotamia.  
Serves him right for doubting my divine rule.  

***
[30 july 1235](http://i.imgur.com/PMcy2ex.jpg)  

Finally, after 6 years of non stop fighting, the realm is at peace.  
When mother took my into the village, I could see the happy faces on the peasants, who are obviously pleased they can safely work their fields again.  
Now let's hope this peace lasts, for I fear my vassals still do not appreciate my rule.  

***
[1 august 1235](http://i.imgur.com/NU6r31R.jpg)  

Now that the war is over, mother found it time for me to begin my education.  
She send me to the court of Osbern, the duke of Syria, to be trained as a proper ruler.  
I didn't like it, as this meant I wouldn't have as much time to play outside.  

***
[27 august 1235](http://i.imgur.com/iBTOivg.jpg)  

My mother couldn't even miss for a month.  
She sent word for me to return back to court.  
A elderly women had arrived, and she would now be assigend as my new guardian.  
I wished mother would educate me, but she is probably too busy ruling my realm.  

***
[23 february 1236](http://i.imgur.com/Mh6vc2i.jpg)  

Word arrive of another horde of barbarians appearing on the borders of Cumania.  
Let us hope they freeze to death in the reacherous north and leave us alone.  

***
[10 march 1236](http://i.imgur.com/kGULxUs.jpg)  

My mother left her bible after praying, and I began readin in it.  
The more I read, the more I became fascinated, always wanting to know more about smiting heathens.  
[My guardian walked in](http://i.imgur.com/2cSkvhT.jpg) on me reading the bible, and she swiftly took it away, encouraging me to go play outside.  
I don't understand why I was not allowed to read God's word.  

***
[19 may 1236](http://i.imgur.com/TghzPvg.jpg)  

My mother told me our realm would be at war again.  
Seeing the state of the heathen kingdom nearby, she wisely decided to declare war on their "Caliph" for lands that are rightfully ours.  
Let's hope fortune is on our side and the war will end swiftly.  

***
[17 semptember 1236]http://i.imgur.com/DEuy10s.jpg)  

We tried to negotiate a treaty with the barbarian hordes to the East.  
We anxiously awaited his return, hoping for a peaceful coexistance.  
The only thing that returned of our message was his disembodied head.  
Mother quickly send me away, but I had already become sick at the sight of the head and emptied my stomach's contents.  
It seems the barbarians have declared war on us, for an invasion of Syria.  
My mother holds me tightly, for we might not be long for this world.  

***
[22 february 1237](http://i.imgur.com/wSPb0EF.jpg)  

The mongol hordes ran rampant through our lands.  
There was nothing we could do.  
Mother send an offer for surrender as soon a she could, to safeguard our peasants, and ourselfs, from the pillaging of the barbarians.  
We have been reduced to a single province, this is not befitting my status as King of Syria.  

***
[22 april 1237](http://i.imgur.com/mRzisX4.jpg)  

I have been planning my revenge against the filthy barbarians.  
I must be patient though and bide my time for the right moment to strike.  
Revenge is a dish best served cold.  

***
[25 october 1237](http://i.imgur.com/U7UcF3A.jpg)  

The pope send a messenger.  
He is upset by our policy of assigning our own bishops and wants to gain control over this.  
My mother, still upset by the barbarian invasions and the lack of help from Rome, refused.  
I can see her faith is waning.  

***
[28 may 1238](http://i.imgur.com/5F151FC.jpg)  

I asked mother for some new playthings today, but she said we don't have the money to afford it.  
This isn't fair, I'm a king, yet the peasents from the village have better toys then I do.  
I envy them, why do they have more than their king?

***
[12 december 1238](http://i.imgur.com/pg5gfRI.jpg)  

Seeing the unhalted conquest of our neighbours at the hands of the mongols, my mother decided to send tribute to the young khan.  
Let us hope that he'll be inclined to not attack us, lest the lackluster tribute might anger him.  

***
[30 december 1238](http://i.imgur.com/bHmTGxy.jpg)  

Some of our neighbours have beens stranded without a liege.  
Mother contacted them asking them to join as, so we can unite against the mongol threat, whatever good it will do.  
One of the counts accepted, whilst the other brazenly refuses.  
The loyal count was swiftly awarded the title "Cupbearer" for his loyal service.  

***
[3 july 1239](http://i.imgur.com/bVtD7qB.jpg)  

The pope called for a crusade to expel the heathens from Sicily.  
Why he would not call a crusade to return my rightful kingdom, Syria, is unbeknownst to me.  
Althouogh we are not in a position to help, we will offer our aid to please the pope.  
We wouldn't gain any lands after all, since the title King of Sicily is already taken by a pious christian.  
It seems the heretical behaviour of the Doge of Pisa does not rest well with the pope.  

***
[16 march 1242](http://i.imgur.com/5vBO8wM.jpg)  

Seeing one of our kinsman being invade by heathens angered my mother, and she told me we had to honor our blood ties.  
We send word that our armies would be marching to join their war, and relief them from the heathen opression.

***
[23 july 1243](http://i.imgur.com/wOfpVnz.jpg)  

My 16th birthday has arrive, but it is no celebration.  
The air is filled with the musty smell of the burnign cities of the neighbouring Byzantine Empire.  
It seems even the mighty basileus couldn't stop the advance of the horde.  
My education did not make a excellent ruler out of me, probably due to all the war time interruptions.  
I can't wait to lead my kingdom back to glory again and take away the titles that the filthy barbarians took, but for now I must bide my time.  

With coming of age comes the promise of marriage, so that I may sire many heirs.  
Choosing a good wife is vital to a good rule.  
I recieved a later from the [Basilissa of the Byzantine Empire](http://i.imgur.com/mZ9pz2i.jpg), offering a betrothal.  
Naturally I accepted, I can't wait to take the Empire from her hands.

[6 august 1243](http://i.imgur.com/A83vNh0.jpg)  

Today my mother approached me with the intent of remarrying.  
I love my mother, and I've never known my father, thus I agreed.  
Let's hope my new father will be nice.  

[14 august 1243]()  

Today was my mother's remarriage.  
It was a small ceremony, considering the times we live in.  
When I left for my throne, I had to bid farewell to my mother, as she has to stay with her new husband to rule his lands.  
Let us hope she'll find happiness.

***
[15 september 1243](http://i.imgur.com/4kl2r09.jpg)  

Alas, my bride to be has lost her titles in the byzantine empire.  
With the loss of her lands, our marriage should be annuled and I began looking for another wife to be.  

***
[5 october 1243](http://i.imgur.com/3q0bhUN.jpg)  

I recieved confirmation of our betrothal, we will marry within a year.  
She may not be the prettiest or the smartest bride, but she has lands far away, save from the clutches of the barbarian hordes.  
When need be, we could move our estates to their lands, and the d'Isigny line will live on 
Now all that is needed is for my to sire an heir.  

***
[17 october 1243](http://i.imgur.com/kmoxCMv.jpg)  

We recieved word that the crusade was succesful.  
Celebration erupted across the christian world, but alas we can't yet celebrate.  
As long as the horde remains on our doorstep we must remain vigilant.  
Our celebrations will come in time, when the horde has been eradicated.

***
[6 december 1243](http://i.imgur.com/PCd522p.jpg)  

As soon as my bride turned 16, we married.  
We held and incospicuous ceremony in the local chapel, trying to not spend money that will be needed for the war effort.  
I decided not to apply for royal aid, to prove to the world that the Kingdom of Syria has not been lost and can hold it's own.  
I urge my wife to share the bed with me, so that we can sire an heir to take over out lands when we pass away.  
Let us hope god blessed my wife with fertility.  

***
[27 december 1244](http://i.imgur.com/LKvOuZz.jpg)  

Out tribute to the mongolian hordes was due again.  
A hefty sum of 334 ducats was send to the khan for his promise not to attack us.  
Let us hope these barbarians at least have a sense of honor.  

***
[7 june 1245](http://i.imgur.com/KaJTFLo.jpg)  

My wife pointed out that I may not be very tactful at diplomacy.  
In order to increase my diplomatic skill, I started having diplomatic discussions with myself in the mirror.  
My wife may say I look ridiculous, but at least I'm improving.  

***
[25 september 1245](http://i.imgur.com/mm0Js3k.jpg)  

While travelling in my carriage towards the birthday of one of my vassals, a tree fell on the road.  
My carriage driver told me we had to take a detour over a backroad.  
On this road our carriage got ambushed all of th sudden.  
I patiently waited in the carriage, knowing I stood no chance against multiple armed assailants.  
They opened the carriage door and thre me outside.  
I offered them a hefty sum of money and my entire possesions, but they merely laughed in my face.  
[They weren't after money, they were after my life](http://i.imgur.com/r4zTkXk.jpg)   
My kinsman, Mabel d'Isigny has hired brigans to take my life, and it seems they'll be succesful at it after all.  
My life flashed before my eyes.  
My lawful lands taken from me by filthy barbarians.  
My lovely wife, with whom I didn't spend enough time, and didn't sire an heir with.  
I guess my uncle in Poland will have to make the best of this situation now.  

[I embraced the sweet cold grip of death](http://i.imgur.com/En2AkWp.jpg)
