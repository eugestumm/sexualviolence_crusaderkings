I Want To TOTALLY Destroy This One Annoying Ass Duchy

The fucking fanatics won’t leave me the hell alone. I have been in near continuous war spiral for the last 3 emperors (I’m playing as the Western Roman Empire-Fallen Eagle Mod) and this one little shit of a duchy (Salzburg) has declared holy war on me no less than 3 times. I have had it with their fanatical overpersisten asses. I wanna give those motherfuckers the Carthage treatment. I wanna burn their cities to the ground, enslave their people, rape the rest, and salt the land. Is there any way to come even close to this? i’ll settle for the ability to destroy city buildings or reduce their development.

As far as I know there is not a way to force it yourself but you can use the mechanic where if a ruler is in debt their counties get negetive modifiers (I don’t know if this only applies to npcs though) there are a few options: 

1. Annex and give to the most I indebted inbred, incapable buffoon in your court so they completely mismanage the place. 

1.5. Give it to an incompetent idiot of a primitive culture. That way the duchy has no technology and cannot develop. 

2. Declare war, siege their capital, ignore their army (unless it is on your important places). Try to capture the duke’s family. From here you ransom their family until their broke, and then you beat their army once so it goes home. Your goal is to make him go as negative as possible so the entire duchy is filled with corrupt officials and bandits. While you’re at it you can kill their entire family by capturing them in sieges.

If you're dead set on it, T3 mental breaks give disasters which (if it's part of your domain) can trigger and destroy stuff and generally make life miserable there.
