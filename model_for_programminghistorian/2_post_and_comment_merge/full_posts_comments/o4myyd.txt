Here is what I *love* about CK2

I have had several playthroughs from the earliest start date to the end, and I have always come away completely awed by the narratives that unfolded. In my recent playthrough, I decided to document each and every ruler, and write a documentary of each one. Some rulers ended up having multiple chapters in my story, and I enjoyed rereading it so much that I put together a [timeline](https://imgur.com/a/bJRNKCc). The timeline was a labor of love, as I got to reread all my stories and remember the fun times. There are love stories, stories of betrayal, rape, revenge, intrigue, hubris, and gallantry.

If I were to write a book or a movie, I would be hard-pressed to choose which story to write about. Some of my top candidates:

- **Blessed Childebrand.** Starting from his visit as an 11-year-old to Lyon to try to secure a marriage to Bladovildis, the daughter of the Count of Lyon, he was passed over in favor of his older brother, the Duke of Toulouse, and, alas, poor Bladovildis subsequently led a short wretched life as his wife. A later betrothal to a Spanish Princess was also repudiated when Childebrand was arrested and imprisoned by his nephew, the Duke of Burgundy (who was, in fact, 9 years older than Childebrand). But Childebrand was charismatic, and he endeared himself to his captor and managed to persuade his cousin to not only release him unharmed but also agree to let him marry the duke’s daughter when she came of age. It was a good deal for both parties, as Austrechild would be a prestigious and powerful match for Childebrand, while the duke could be assured of the support of his troublesome vassal.
- **Ogier the Missionary.** Placed on the throne at the age of 7, early challenges to the child-emperor’s reign threatened to plunge the new empire (which had been established in the final year of his father's reign) into civil war. Ogier's council was staffed by the usual mix of malcontents and pragmatists who were looking out only for their own interests, and Ogier's only supporter, Gozhelm of France, died 2 years into the young emperor's reign. A serious plot to replace Ogier with his older sister, Sophie (who had 3 healthy sons), was thwarted by Duke Abram of Lower Lorraine and his half brother, Willichar, not out of love or duty to the emperor, but because Ogier was *their* puppet, and they wanted to keep it that way. For their role in uncovering the plot, Abram was promoted to King of France, while Willichar was granted a county of his own. When Emperor Ogier was 15, he fell in love with a 16-year-old noblewoman named Isabelle and he repudiated his promise to marry the 17-year-old Empress of Alba and fought a war for Isabelle's hand, the complication being that Isabelle was already married. He won the war (known as Isabelle's War) but never won her hand. At 17, Ogier was betrayed by Pope Leo IV, who encouraged him to go to war against Bavaria, privately hoping to bog him down in an unwinnable war, and then when Ogier started winning the war, the pope excommunicated him. Ogier would never forgive this betrayal (known as “The Great Betrayal”), and in response, he permitted heretics and fugitives from the Catholic Church to live within his empire. At this point also, Ogier came under the spell of an older woman Adaluildis (who had also been his father's mistress and confidante) and she took him to bed and mentored him in the ways of imperial rulership. At 20, Ogier finally found the woman he would marry. Bertenildis was everything Ogier was not; Ogier was a pretty boy Latin Frenchman, forbidden by law to lead troops (a rule implemented after the disastrous reign of Mad King Gedalca), while Bertenildis was a Frankish military woman, an inspiring leader to her troops, but not known at all for her looks. (One chronicler called her “homely.”) One can see, though, why a young man forbidden from military service might be taken by such a woman. Unfortunately, like Isabelle, the 16-year-old Bertenildis was married, but by lucky chance her husband would die under suspicious circumstances soon thereafter, and Ogier, with some difficulty, was able to persuade the young Bertenildis to join him on the Francian throne, granting her the title Queen of Crusader Aquitaine. Ogier had an active early reign, fighting first the Byzantine Empire for Germany, then pushing the Saracens out of Francia. (Bertenildis herself donned armor and led troops in the conquest of Rosello.) Plague spread through the empire the next year, followed by a revolt during which peasants forced their way into the imperial palace and attacked the young emperor in his bedroom. Ogier sustained a disfiguring wound to his face; the pretty boy would no longer be talked of as the handsome emperor. No rest for the still-young emperor, who, at 31, faced a serious civil war as the Duke of Gelre rallied half the empire to try to overthrow his rule and restore the power of the dukes. After 11 years of civil war, Ogier was able to finally suppress the rebellion, but he lost his wife in the process, Empress Bertenildis, who was assassinated by a ducal plot. Victory in the civil war, however, gave Ogier the strength to do what had long been suspected: he came out as Waldensian, in direct opposition to the Catholic Church. He used this as an opportunity to bring the defeated dukes back to his side: Waldensianism, he said, did not allow capital punishment; convert to Waldensianism, he offered, and he would spare their lives and let them keep all their titles. Unsurprisingly, most dukes took the offer, and as a result, he developed a lot of support for his opposition to the pope. After 7 years of peace, the enmity between the emperor and the pope finally boiled over, and Catholics and Waldensians all over Europe went to war with each other. In the end, Ogier found himself in control of Rome. Pope Nicolaus II fled, and Ogier declared himself King of Rome. To celebrate, Ogier remarried, marrying the devout Waldensian, Maddalena the Fair, who would be credited for the almost 40 years of peace that followed (“Maddalena’s Peace”). Alas, after a successful reign, Ogier's end would not be a pleasant one. A plot by secret Catholics led by the Duke of Thurgau and Prince-Archbishop Louis of Cologne resulted in his castration and subsequent death. Ogier’s reputation is complicated. Ogier singlehandedly destroyed the Catholic Church, and there is no doubt that Ogier strengthened the Francian Empire, but he severely depleted its treasury fighting a prolonged civil war. Hailed as a saint by many for overthrowing the corrupt pope, Ogier was despised by the many Catholics who remained in Francia. And, worse, his empire was split between his 3-year-old twin sons upon his death. (Tragically, all the sons Bertenildis had borne him had predeceased him.)
- **Léonard II.** Léonard ascended the throne under a cloud of suspicion, as he should never have been emperor had it not been for the untimely deaths of his brother and 2 nephews, one of which happened to have fallen to his death while Léonard was visiting Chalons. Léonard proclaimed his innocence and nothing could be proven, but he was exiled to Wales for 17 years before being recalled after Emperor André died. Even after taking the purple, Emperor Léonard sought to clear his name by launching another investigation into the death of Galasso III, but it was again inconclusive. Emperor Léonard sought to improve relations in the east and strengthen the few Christians out there by marrying his daughters to eastern princes, but both marriages resulted in disaster, with the fate of the younger (and most beautiful) daughter resulting in a national tragedy now called “The Rape of Elisabeth.” The Rape of Elisabeth resulted in a series of reforms throughout the empire to improve the position of women in society. Leadership and military service were opened to women, and a century later we see the rise of the great female generals: Helvis St. Abraham, Aude, and the greatest of all, Blanche. During his reign, Léonard continued the reconquest of Spain, and after the death of his first wife, Léonard married the young Scottish Princess Róis. Léonard, who had spent his exile in Wales and was familiar with British political intrigue, then arranged the murder of 6 successive Alban emperors and empresses in order to place his wife on the Alban throne, though by this time she had fallen out of favor and Empress Róis spent the first 6 years of her reign in a Francian prison. She would later go on to wear the British crown not once but twice and fight a generation-long civil war in Britain that would result in the final eradication of Roman Catholicism.
- **Diogenes II.** His two older brothers having died in The Plague (along with the revered Lavinia of Blois, a real-life Lyanna Mormont), Diogenes secured the right of females to inherit the Francian throne on the same standing as males. This was in response to The Plague, which had greatly depleted the royal family and could have resulted in a succession crisis and civil war had Diogenes himself not survived. Diogenes came of age in the post-plague years, when everyone was happy just to be alive. The Francian treasury was full, and the combination of youth and money resulted in lots of sex. His marriage to an eastern princess, Yildiz, didn't last, and she returned to her home in the east after being the subject of an argument between Diogenes and one of his mistresses, Duchess Thora of Gotland, who was jealous of the emperor's relationship with his own wife. Both Yildiz and Thora left (though Thora would return within a year), and Emperor Diogenes continued his affairs with numerous young women, most notably, the 15-year-old Patrizia. After having his marriage to Yildiz annulled, he married the absolutely stunningly gorgeous Hypatia of Dyrrachion. Unfortunately, Hypatia was not as libertine as Diogenes's court, and she refused to partake in his sex games. (She was also not happy when Empress Yildiz and Duchess Thora both bore him children after Hypatia's marriage to the emperor, and then Diogenes's 15-year-old ward Patrizia also bore him a child some months later.) Hypatia grew to despise her husband and refused him. On the last day of January, 1373, Emperor Diogenes invited the beautiful Hypatia to the catacombs, one of the palace’s many pleasure rooms beneath the castle, where he attempted to rape the beautiful empress. In the struggle, Hypatia stabbed the emperor to death. Emperor Diogenes was just 29 years old and had ruled as emperor for 20 years. He was succeeded by his young daughter Empress Valence, who would be raised by a trio of women: her mother Yildiz, Duchess Thora, and Vicereine Patrizia (who was not much older than the young empress, but who had been granted the Viceroyalty of Navarra on the birth of her daughter). All three would do a good job of protecting the young empress, and Patrizia (known to history as Patrizia the Unchaste) would become a close friend to Empress Valence. (Hypatia herself lived a rather awkward life after murdering her husband. With help from the court, she escaped back to Dyrrachion—she was never pursued—and she lived another 44 years in pseudo-exile. She never remarried or had children.)

Great stories!

This is amazing! I too find this one of the best ways to enjoy the game, and like you have had many events that make for wonderful stories. Like you I also try to document my rulers, and I feel like I have quite bit stronger connection to them than I would if I had not done so. I guess the only differences between us is that the campaign I'm documenting is in CK3, not CK2, but that doesn't even matter in this context. Keep up the good work, and if you decide to upload some more stuff I'd surely be looking forward to it!
