About revolts happening when you're a horselord.

Has anyone here played as a horse lord and done all your horse lordy stuff like raping and pillaging your way from Mongolia to Poland. And you get these constant "uprisings" that have no troops and don't actually start a war. Like right now I'm on my 20th orthodox revolt and I haven't fought a single rebellion in the region.
