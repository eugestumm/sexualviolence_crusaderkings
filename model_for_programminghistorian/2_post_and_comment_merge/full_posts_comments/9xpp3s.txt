Shower Thought I Had

I like playing as a Norse (like most people I think) because I love just sailing around and raiding people. I’d ignore everything else in the game just to raid random people if I could.

My strategy revolves around landing my Vikings in England or Spain or some other place with a long coastline and then marching them along the coast, raping and pillaging anything in their way until they’re physically unable to rape and pillage anymore. All the whiled our raiding fleets sail along the coast waiting for us to finish raiding. So, that’s where my shower thought comes in:

Is this the medieval equivalent of ‘ghost riding the whip?’
