A conversation with my marshal (2)

***Marshal:*** The war effort us going excellent my liege, we now control over 50% of the enemy's territory.

**King**: Splendid, soon Aquitaine will be once more part of the French empire.

&#x200B;

***Messenger***: My king, news from home, viking raiders are attacking our chores.

**King**: Those damn savages, how do they even know when to attack, knowing our armies are busy in the South, where do they get their intelligence?

***Marshal***: My king, the proclamation of this war has of course been sent out to all known rulers to back up the legitimicy of your claim to the throne.

**King**: Really? Sharing such vital information with potential enemies doesn't seem like a goed idea... Anyway, those poor villagers up North can't be helped, we have to focus on our enemy in the South first.

***Messenger***: They're not just attacking villages Sire, they're marching on the capital.

**King**: Goddamn savages, alright then, Marshal gather our troops, we'll chase these vikings off our shores first, then return to Aquitaine when they're all dead or fled.

&#x200B;

***Messenger 2***: My king, bad news, the raiders have sacked the capital and kidnapped your wife and queen.

**King**: My beloved wife! Marshal we need to hurry, we should be able to catch them before they board their ships.

&#x200B;

***Marshal***: My king, we caught up to the enemy and were victorious in battle, the last remaining raiders are fleeing and we reclaimed all the gold and valuables they stole.

**King**: What about the prisoners?

***Marshal***: We made quite a few prisoners of war Sire, they've been transferred to your dungeons.

**King**: Not them, the prisoners they took, where is my wife?

***Marshal***: They didn't have prisoners with them Sir, they took them to their capital in Sweden.

**King**: What? When?

***Marshal***: After they raided our capital, my king.

**King**: But we stopped them before they could reach their homeland.

***Marshal***: Yes we did, we stopped their army, it was a glorious battle.

**King**: Then how did the prisoners get away?

***Marshal***: They were already back at their capital, Sire.

**King**: But how? They didn't teleport there, did they?

***Marshal***: ...

**King**: Fine, arrange a ransom with their king and get our army ready to march back South.

&#x200B;

***Messenger 3***: My king, the viking king refused your ransom.

**King**: Why... That bastard.

***Messenger 3***: He also took your beloved wife as a concubine.

**King**: Goddamnit. Alright, that's it, I'll make peace with Aquitaine for now and get my wife back by force.

***Court Chaplain***: My liege, she is no longer your wife.

**King**: What? Why are you here? What are you talking about?

***Court Chaplain***: I came to tell you, your ex-wife was taken as a concubine by a pagan king. This means that in the eyes of God you're officially no longer married. You have no obligation to go and save her.

**King**: You're all crazy, of course I will save her, I love her.

***Court Chaplain***: Of course Sire, but before you do, you should consider marrying someone new, it's not right for someone of your position to be unmarried.

**King**: Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?

&#x200B;

**King**: Marshal, prepare us for war with this viking kingdom in the North. 

***Marshal***: Of course, Sire, which Casus Belli should I quote?

**King**: We're going to free my wife.

***Marshal***: That's not a real Casus Belli, my king.

**King**: I don't care, you think of something.

***Marshal***: Of course, my liege, how about a holy war? They are pagans after all.

**King**: Great, as long as I get my wife back...

***Marshal***: You mean the enemy's concubine? She resides at the capital, a holy war for the kingdom should give us the greatest chance of success.

**King**: Fine.

&#x200B;

***Marshal***: My king, it's been almost a year, our troops are exhausted, but we are finally victorious, the enemy capital has fallen, the viking king has surrendered. You are now not just the king of France, but the king of Sweden as well.

**King**: Finally, I will be reunited with my wife.

***Marshal***: You mean the concubine, Sire? After her king's surrender, he lost all his titles. His courtiers and concubines moved to his brother's court, a duchy up north.

**King**: What? Why wouldn't she stay and be reunited with her beloved husband?

***Marshal***: She is no longer your wife, my liege.

**King**: But why would she move to a random duke's court?

***Marshal***: Not random my liege, he's the brother of the man who made her his concubine. That's where her duties lie.

**King**: But she was forced into that position, surely no-one would expect her to remain loyal to the people who kidnapped and raped her?

***Marshal***: ...

**King**: Goddamnit. So is she now this duke's concubine?

***Marshal***: Just his courtier, Sire.

**King**: So she is free to leave if I invite her to my court?

***Marshal***: The duke dislikes you my king, he won't let her leave.

**King**: Marshal, prepare our troops.

&#x200B;

*- one generation later-* 

***Marshal***: And that my boy, is the story of how your father, once king of France, became the emperor of all of Scandinavia, and you now rule this frozen wasteland rather than your warm, culturally significant homeland in the South.

Heh

This is great haha

Concubine? More like concuMINE

This should be a Monty Python Sketch.

> Messenger: My king, news from home, Viking raiders are attacking our chores.

I’m jealous. I wish Viking raiders would attack my chores.

>King: But she was forced into that position, surely no-one would expect her to remain loyal to the people who kidnapped and raped her?

Seems like this king has never heard of Stockholm syndrome. :\^)

This has strong Door Monster sketch energy and I love it.

Very true

You should check out the mod: Prisoner’s of war

Love it.

Hilarious!

I laughed! Have my upvote

This reminds me of the ads for CK2 when it was released.

Made me chuckle and the meddlesome priest line is a perfect reference

This is some the best and funniest writing I’ve seen on this board. I love that you framed it as a dialog. Please keep posting these!

Edit: The earlier one was very good too.

We all been there.

This is just so spot on
