Glorious Basilius....not.

I started an Ironman in TGO with the intent of creating a Roman Empire as Basil, then fighting the Aztecs in a few hundred years. But my Council seems to be useless, as there are only so many seats and far too many vassals to pacify them all. By the fifth year of my second ruler, the Council has all the power and the succession is Elective. I like the added hardness of Conclave, but...damn. I raised all my forces to defeat one Elective Uprising that Shattered Retreated away from my army until they gathered together and raped it to pieces. Immediately after that I was hit with a bunch of opportunist factions that stripped me of what remaining power I had left and gave everything to the Council.

Now all my Council members STILL hate me because I'm holding votes that I'm not giving to them, and because I have too many duchies...duchies I can't give away because they won't let me because they hate me for having too many. I smell an independence faction on the horizon, and this may just be the most disastrous Byzantibe game I've ever run. 

So wat do?

Step one: Get the dissenters.
Step 2 : Eat them all
And now the most important step трч. You must not shit for many months. When time comes right, dissent will eat itself.
