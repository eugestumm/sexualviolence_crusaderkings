Why is having affairs as norse criminal?

Correct me if I’m wrong but these are the guys that raided and raped all over england, why is having an affair as a man bad? Concubines don’t give adulterous trait and they’re basically just lovers with a fancier title.

Concubines were official, an affair is not. Taking slaves as concubines was a thing too, but nobody would be OK with you sleeping with another guys woman.

A concubine is still someone who is to an extent formally attached to a man, like a second class wife. Sleeping with another person's spouse is a different matter.
