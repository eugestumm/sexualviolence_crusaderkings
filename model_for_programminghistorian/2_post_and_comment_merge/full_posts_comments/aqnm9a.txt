Venice has frustrating design

Currently in the age of getting raped by Vikings, I'm OK constantly fending off the other territories I've conquered (Split, Raugia, Zara, Ravenna) but god it is incredibly annoying being raided by a 2K stack on Venice as when I hire mercs, they spawn at low morale in Veglia and I have to call in my ships and just accept the low morale ship landing penalty. By then, I've already lost the trade post and have to build it again and sometimes I lose the battle due to the morale penalties and just have to sit back and allow the whole "island" to be pillaged. This happens every 3 months right now, I'm kinda ready to be done with Venice. Any advice for a tilted player?

Retinues

Keep all your retinues stationed in the island

Your personal levies in Venice should be more than enough to utterly anihilate the viking raider. Even a large viking raiding party will rarely have more than 2000 raiders, and they disenbark with half morale. Your palace levies plus a couple cities in your demense should create around 3000/4000 troops. Just raise them as soon as the raider land and enjoy the massacre. 

This is why you don't kill off other patrician families (at least towards the endgame). They'll keep their own retinues around which'll stack with yours when defending against raiders.
At one point, our combined retinue was so large I had to shift some of mine off Venice to avoid attrition lol
