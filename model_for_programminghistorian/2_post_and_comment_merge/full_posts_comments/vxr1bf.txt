No game accomplishes to stress me out like CK3 does

I started off as a Jewish faith in Africa in 1066. First 300 years pretty good; I expand and take over all of eaten Africa and some parts of the Middle East. I’m close to restoring Israel. All I need is a few counties. Emperor dies and with that factions arise. I take care of some, but they keep coming not stop. I try to declare war on the last few counties I need, but 4 independent factions, and one overthrowing factions rape me and while that is happening I get invaded by another nation while being at war with the counties I declared war on. I pretty much lost and now half of my land is gone. Only 80 years left in the play through. I think I’m giving it up and starting from scratch. 

PS Allie’s are useless. They just sit around and do nothing. Wish I can command them or give them advice or something

AI allies will usually just follow your troops.  I've noticed they'll sometimes stand in a holding near you while you're sieging, but usually they just link to your army.

I had a game that i started as Cagliari on 867 only to be randomly invaded by a muslim kingdom and die, after a few years into the game, stuff like this happened before with other nations i played as, it's so random i don't get how stuff like this are in the game.
