Liege took ALL of my money....

I was about an two hours into my Tukish Iron man game. Had a rough start with my first character dying a bit early and my liege becoming a very powerful too quickly. 

So I was biding my time and had managed to save up around 1300 gold as a single county Count. 

Just as I was about to set out to conquer my dejure duchy an event fired that claimed my character had been accused of raping the daughter of my liege. A trial was held and I was found guilt. I was forced to pay a "heavy fine" which result in my liege taking every single cent of my money. Bring me down to a total of zero gold.

Needless to say I was pissed. 

Anyone ever had this event happen to them before?

Little tip next time, when the event fires before you click to pay the fine, spend as much as you can. Build a new Castle in your County and upgrade your Capitol. It's gamey, but not unreasonable given the circumstances.

Yeah, you really don't want to be marshal if you have the lustful trait.

I was put on trial by one of the Karlings but he found me innocent. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/w7SyHbW.png)

I have no idea if this is random or if certain traits influence their choice.

Next time rape a lowborn foreigner, no one will care.
