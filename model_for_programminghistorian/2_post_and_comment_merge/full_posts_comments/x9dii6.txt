"Exile" characters

Does anyone else have a piece of headcanon to explain one of their leaders? For instance, my current King of Viken (gonna be of Norway) character is culturally Greek and the biological son of two Hellenes executed by the Emperor, and his entire life's work is to destroy Christianity and burn Constantinople. He was adopted by the former king when he saved his daughter from being raped (a la Uhtred from TLK).

In reality, I wanted to be able to castrate and blind people as well as have 3 concubines.
