Wife does of explosive vomiting ! *GONE WRONG*

Come near, oh you who want to hear the story of a poor unlucky fool whose vomitting wife was a poisoned gift !

4 years ago, I saw that my wife had a claim on the byzantine throne. Wonderful ! Our marriage is a regular one, so her heir is also mine, which means that wife + war + heir = T H I C C empire in a few years.

So there I go with my legions of crusading dudes, raping and pillaging everything we see. Constantinople on sight ! Time to rape and pillage RICH PEOPLE ! After a two year siege, the city falls to my unending streams of angry crusaders (we're orthodox christian too, so that's kinda the strange crusade). Warscore is at 85%, the current Basileos had to change then-shit covered pants many times since the end of the siege. Everything is fine.

But then, after a good session of ~~unjustified violence~~ cultural exchange, my steward reaches me kinda worried. Hm ? What's that ? There's a problem with my wife ? 

...You found her covered in vomit in her chamber ? And she's dead. Huh. What did you write in the reports ? "Wife died explosively vomitting on the 6 april 1267" ? Yeah that's ok. But uh, so we're done here ? Yes ? Well, ok boys, war's done, casus belli no longer valid, time to go home.

So after literally setting the whole Byzantine on fire, we just went away, to the pleasure of the ~~Greeks~~ Romans, I guess. No fancy latin crusader states, no muhamedians taking advantage on the situation, no turkey in the future. Just a big stack of disappointment/dead soldiers.

Thank you, explosively vomiting for wasting thousands of life just to die in your own puke. Oh well, I was fucking her sister anyway.

She probably would have caved to factions, but still, infuriating nonetheless.

Good ending : I did not forget to close the fucking gates to prevent the hordes of smallpox ridden courtiers to enter
