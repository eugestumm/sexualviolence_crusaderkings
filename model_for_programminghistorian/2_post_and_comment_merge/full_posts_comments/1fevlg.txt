[**27th February 1203:**](http://min.us/llZEGFi9nuwuq)

Yesterday, I got news that my father is dead. I never really had a great relationship with my father, but...I'm deeply saddened by his loss, and I don't know what I will do. I now have command of the biggest empire in Europe, and I feel like a mouse surrounded by lions. I ordered my fathers will read out, in which he proclaimed all his lands and titles handed to me, along with...something odd. He proclaimed he also wanted a book handed down to me. It was brought from my fathers chambers to me as I ate with my wives. At first I discounted it, but later on in the night I could not sleep. Eventually I decided to read it, and it turns out that my father, and his father before him and so on, kept a diary of his life, so that the story of House Abdeddit may survive the tests of time.

I sat up all night reading it, and I have decided to follow the tradition. In hundreds of years, when my descendant sits upon the throne of the Empire of Europe, historians will look back on these diaries to teach the children about the rise of House Abdeddit. My first order of business, is to send couriers to every corner of the lands, to spread word to my vassals that I have succeeded the throne.

I have also decided to continue my fathers war for Mangyshlak, but I have stood down some of the levies coming from the northern parts of my empire. I do this because it would take too long for the levies to reach the battleground, and we already outnumber their forces seven to one.

[**13th March 1203:**](http://min.us/l20jEgdtAqbLC)

Today, I called my first council meeting. They walked in single file, one by one, all visibly tired and exhausted. I had put them to work immediately, trying to keep stability in the realm. They had been working harder than ever, so imagine their surprise when I replaced them all. I...Didn't feel good about it. But I need strong advisers if I am to keep this empire. It would not take much for the heathens to invade us at this point. I gathered the best of the best from all over the lands for my council, and I even made a new friend. My feel my Marshall, Bay Aepak, is completely loyal to me. With all other new councillors, I could feel the deceit in their eyes, and it scares me. Bay Aepak, however, is either a deceitful snake or truly a friend to be trusted. I will go with the latter, I need some reassurance in these troubled times.

[**28th April 1203:**](http://min.us/lbwJCZDniogfS7)

I just got word that the 2000 men who were raised in Embra, did not get out of the province fast enough to escape the Khwarzim army. I am disgusted and infuriated at this. Over 1000 of our men were slaughtered, how could my Marshall make such a novice mistake? I was about to let it at him but... the way he looked at me. In his eyes I could see a mixture of remorse and power that scared me. I averted my eyes almost immediately. I regret it now, how am I supposed to show my power if I cannot even look my friends and vassals in the eye?

[**8th May 1203:**](http://min.us/lbxJDSCgGuO087)

 The horde has been assembled, and is marching to meet the Khwarzim army in open battle. We have eight times their number, and some of the best commanders in charge of the army! With sound advice from my Marshall, I have placed Kilic, Itak and the Marshall himself in charge of the army, split up with 5000 troops each. The Khwarzims are going to regret not peacefully giving his lands to the rightful ruler. I just wish I didn't have to have to go to war. But, sins of the father and all that. Also, it shows I am a strong ruler... Something I'm not. I don't like the needless killing over tracts of land, but it is the way of Allah and life, and so it shall be.

[**28th May 1203:**](http://min.us/lbjz4vu6LaWQP9)

Allahu Akbar! God has seen fit to grant me a beautiful baby daughter, (though I would have liked to have a son) truly Allah is merciful. I have named her Usunbike, after my beautiful wife (even though she did not birth her.) I know that the girl will grow up to be beautiful.

[**31st May 1203:**](http://min.us/liyhpTmmRt18G)

After some pondering, I have decided to grant the Beylik of Saray to my trusted friend and adviser, Aepak. I have done so not only as a gift, but as my total holdings are too big for my steward to properly administer. There is also growing discontent among my vassals about my number of holdings. I do not wish for a rebellion, so I'm going to lessen my holdings over the next couple of months.

[**1st June 1203:**](http://min.us/lKcA6dKOAX6qd)

Over the previous days, my spymaster has been feeding me rumours, about my brother plotting against my rule. At first I thought they were lies, fed to me to breed dissent. But, later my spymaster came back to me, this time with damning evidence about my brothers treason. He urged me to send for my brothers arrest immediately, but I held off on it. I wanted to confront him first, maybe there was some mistake? I went to my brothers chambers to accuse him and to my horror, he did not even flinch in admitting it! He said I was a craven usurper, and that I did not deserve to rule! I was taken aback, afraid, and I tried to reason with my brother. I asked him to reconsider his actions, but he would have none of it. He says he and other dukes were planning to rebel. I'm shocked that he would outright admit it... Quite frankly I'm disgusted. I've had him arrested and thrown in the dungeons, and he is to stay there.

[**6th June 1203:**](http://min.us/l5L13SKPS8MKS) 

I've got great news indeed! My Marshall tells me that we have crushed their armies with minimal loss to ours. Allahu Akbar!

[**14th June 1203:**](http://min.us/lejYkYkXrF9Ky) Today I got word that one of my courtiers has murdered themselves! I would not call myself a zealot, but any servant of Allah that would do such a thing disgusts me! But... I can not help but feel myself feeling pity for the soul that would prefer eternal damnation rather than live their life. Against my Court Imams wishes, I have not desecrated her name. But I will not pay for her funeral.

[**14th July 1203:**](http://min.us/lbsb6z5jsED3ku) 

I just got word from my Marshall after my last entry, that the army of Khwarzim has been completely destroyed! Again, I cannot help but feel pity for the soldiers' lives that have been lost, those who had no choice in whether they fought. I guess I am in a pitiful state today. Perhaps this is why people openly plot against me, I'm too kind! I must teach them to fear my wrath.

[**12th August 1203:**](http://min.us/lbuUsS8Jpgvm0v) 

I was told today by my Court Imam that the Nestorian heresy has appeared in the province of Murom! I was playing with my children, teaching them games when I was asked to see Timariot. I dispatched him to the province at once, but I asked him to try and crush the heresy with as little casualties as possible. He seemed taken aback, but agreed. As he was walking out, I heard him sniggering at me, but I did not do anything. I'm a pathetic ruler.

[**9th September 1203:**](http://min.us/lqfdfddDw1ss7) 

Words cannot describe the terror I am feeling right now. I was in my office, writing letters, when I hear screaming and gurgling. I jumped up from my chair, terrified, and opened the door. I asked my guard to go see what the commotion was. He ran off, only to come back with my spymaster covered in blood. I screamed as he collapsed in front of me, coughing blood while extra spilt out of his torso. The blood was a dark crimson and I nearly fainted at the sight of it. He kept crawling towards me as I edged backwards, but he managed to whisper one thing. One, terrible name. “Hashshashin.” I have guards searching the entire castle, but the killer has not been found. I have tripled my guard and I'm taking extra precautions to not be alone ever. I have scheduled Court Imam to have 1000 prayers sent to Allah in my name. Allah is merciful.

[**12th September 1203:**](http://min.us/lFIVVninAQFwO) 

Today I have a new spymaster. His name is Kotyan of Tver, and I am told he is good at his job. I damn well hope so, the castle is still on lock down after Banyok was murdered right next to me! I have ordered him to dispatch spies to hunt down the Hashshashin and destroy them. I commissioned him a third of the treasury and sent him off to do his work.

[**20th October 1203:**](http://min.us/lNHWUjzpxY9LE) 

I have had it with these damn rebels! It seems every day I have more peasants cropping up in rebellion in more and more provinces, refusing to work and in some cases, attempting to take the province for themselves! I was content with having them peacefully settle down, but everywhere I look my people are unfaithful! It seems I cannot rule with kindness, so I shall rule with fear. I vow that as soon as my war with Khwarzim is finished, I will slaughter all rebels, and their families. They shall learn to fear me.

[**20th December 1203:**](http://min.us/lzYWrxT8iaT42) 

Today is a day for celebration indeed! Today I received the letter of surrender from Khwarzim. I have already assembled a banquet for all at my castle, and I plan a huge feast for all my vassals to enjoy. Perhaps now that I have finished my conquest, people will learn to treat me with the fear I deserve.

[**8th January 1204:**](http://min.us/lD4HHKOLK0IaV) 

Today I had to make a hard decision. My vassal, Bey Arrak, accused my brother of inappropriately eyeing his wife, with 'lust in his eyes'. I did not want to believe such an accusation, but I know it to be true. While I was growing up, my brother would always visit brothels, and I heard rumours of him raping courtiers. He is a horrible man. When I was a child, he would always mercilessly beat me while I cried and begged for mercy. Instead of stopping he would laugh and beat me until I had no more tears to cry. I've always wanted an excuse to imprison him, now I have it. I don't feel any remorse for the monster, and I will leave him to rot in the dungeons. Also, it does not hurt that this act will gain me influence with Bey Arrak.

[**29th April 1204:**](http://min.us/lFfrAsk7zKRWU) 

It has been a long time since I have written in this diary. Truth be told, not much has happened. It has been relatively peaceful, but today marks the beginning of more bloodshed. Seven thousand men have been chosen to crush the traitors that plague my empire. Today was the first battle of many, and I have been told every single one of the rebels has either been killed or arrested in Chastye. Allahu Akbar!

**21st May 1204:**

Recently a courtier named Songul (honey to my ears, that name!) and I have been exchanging flirtatious gestures. She is beauty personified, her hair as black as coal and soft as the finest silk. Earlier today, I could contain myself no more, and I visited her chambers in the castle. I surprised her, but she was happy to give herself to me, and we had a lovely romp in the tower. I truly love her, but we both have to stay quiet, for her honour and mine.

[**22nd September 1204:**](http://min.us/lbbaGTqD2UtaTs) 

Today, I received a letter in which Timariot Yaroslav has been accused of being a heretic by my Court Imam, and he wishes of me to remove this brand. I responded, saying that my Court Imam would never be wrong in accusing a heretic, and that all shall know about his degenerate ways. I don't think he'll like it very much, but I have full faith in my Court Imam. Along with this, I wrote a letter to the Imam, applauding him for his great work and keen eye, along with a gift of money.

[**3rd January 1205:**](http://min.us/lbaWskL5CHXeaC) 

Again, it has been a while since I have written in this book. I fear I have been in a bit of a depressed state since the news of my Marshall, and friend's, death. Today, I write to say that my primary title has been changed from Volga Bulgaria, to the Empire of Rus. I have done so to distinguish myself from my ancestors, and because... I like the name better. Hopefully the peasants will embrace the new cultural identity and change in name. Rus has a certain name to it that rolls off the tongue well, certainly better than Volga Bulgaria. I have also placed a new Marshall on my council. His name is Beylerbey Honek of Perm, and he is a great commander if people are to be believed. He will serve me well, I hope.

[**28th February 1205:**](http://min.us/lbpHyxbDAIngfL) 

Allah give me strength. It has come to light that my romantic affair with Songul Kopti, my love, has produced a bastard! This is bad for both of us, as Songul is not married, and I am not married to her! I have deliberated for a while... The choice has been difficult, but I have decided to legitimize the boy. My children will hate me for it, as will my wives. But it is the good thing to do.

[**10th March 1205:**](http://min.us/lTFQFTjYR4zte) 

For the past week I have been engrossed in a strange book I found in the castle library. It tells the tale of a pilgrims journey to Mecca, and the many perils he faces. It is beautiful, and though I may struggle with some of the words, I am enamoured with this story. I am convinced that there is a deeper meaning behind this, and I will find it!

[**6th April 1205:**](http://min.us/l7wBchIL64xcH) It is time I show the might of the my great empire, and crush the forces of Hungary once and for all! They are weak and plagued by rebellions at this moment, so I must strike quickly! I have pressed my rightful claim for the region of Kiev, as it is de jure part of my lands. Hungary were my fathers enemies, and they are now mine. I have no kindness in my heart for the infidels of Catholic Europe, and they will all be crushed, beginning with Hungary. Allahu Akbar! I have called my brother in law, Sultan Aydin of Khiva, into my war, in return for joining his already won conquest. Although I doubt Aydin will actually send any troops, it is worth the gamble I reckon. Anyway, Aydins enemies do not pose a threat to us.

***Continued below...***

> Leave me, now. Thank you for writing my words. You can stop now, you blustering idio

Heh.

***...continued from above***

[**17th April 1205:**](http://min.us/lbbuZWM1EPyUwC) 

I have gotten word that my spymaster grossly underestimated the size of Hungary's army. If we are to defeat them in the field of battle, then we must hire mercenaries to bolster the flanks. I have enlisted The Alan Raiders, and even though their leader is an infidel, he is a great commander and the company is cheap to hire. We will win, we definitely will! Then they will see who the true craven is!

[**18th August 1205:**](http://min.us/lSZYUi7Iw3rOk) 

It seems that Hungary's armies outnumber us by 3000. But all is not lost, I am told the commanders behind Hungary are aggressive and foolish, they prefer to assault castles and lose many men rather than wait and starve them out. I have given the order for our horde to wait for them to whittle their numbers down. It's simply the best strategy, one that will lead us to glory! Also, the mercenaries have still not joined up with the main force. This is going to go well!

[**14th November 1205:**](http://min.us/lD9dU4fwaxaud) 

The army still waits, but my Imam does not. I have just gotten word that he has converted one of my vassals, Malusha of Gdov, the Sunni faith! I was not aware he was not Muslim, but it is good that we have one more brother among our ranks.

[**28th December 1205:**](http://min.us/lxKfJjL93SLlI) 

Today's diary entry consists of military matters, scholars and historians of the future. I have decided that I am sick of not being able to understand all the phrases and tactics being thrown about by my generals,when I sit in on my war councils. I am hereby going to be taught in military matters by my Marshall in his spare time. Perhaps, if it ever comes to it, I won't be such a craven and a coward if I am ever forced to lead an army. In other news, the Hungarian army has beaten itself down enough as to be weak enough for us to attack. We now march towards Chernigov where we will flank the Hungarian army, and then free the province. Death to infidels!

[**27th January 1206:**](http://min.us/lrP6BqHzWbzJ0) 

The fighting begins. I am worried, scared even, about the outcome of events. I have great trust in my commanders, and I know that my commanders are all more experienced than on the Hungarian side. With our horse archers, I know we will win.

[**4th March 1206:**](http://min.us/lbcgKSS7K4sKzv) 

I... I don't know how to write this down. I guess I shall have to. This is an important event in my families history. A shocking defeat at the hands of the Hungarians, despite innumerable odds. Twenty two thousand Rus' men have been slaughtered, all thanks to the blunders of our amateur commanders. My heart hangs heavy. Such a colossal amount of men being sent to heaven before their time. But Allah will treat them well. I have asked that every Mosque have religious services open all day every day for the next month in honour of the brave souls lost today. I am worried, though. How could such a thing happen, in our own lands? I am worried. It was so easy for them to crush our best, and now they advance on the stragglers. We are truly doomed.

[**10th May 1206:**](http://min.us/lbfpr8NRU7clpv) 

Today my vassal, Bey Ituk of Mordva, approached me and pleaded with me to release my brother, Prince Tunga, from my dungeon. It took a long time, but with careful words and great flattery, I was able to explain why I cannot release my brother, and I was able to have Ituk converted to my side of the situation. I have an inkling that he had a hand in the plots of my brother, but no matter. I will be kind. Kindness is needed in this year.

[**27th May 1206:**](http://min.us/lbfiNgP9H6fjM2) 

Allah smiles upon me, my wife Gunduz is pregnant once again! This is a golden nugget of good news amongst so much bad.

[**30th July 1206:**](http://min.us/lbgkI8mJ8rFNis) 

Not again...Not again! Just as I thought I was safe, I was proven wrong. I was enjoying a stroll through the palace garden with my friend, Kubasar, contemplating life and death, and the beauty of heaven when I heard a whiz, then gurgling. I turned to see a dagger buried in my friends throat, as it gushes with blood like a fountain. I screamed and threw myself to the floor, and my guards rushed me to safety. As we were running inside, I saw the assassin, robed and dressed like the Hashshashin, scurrying over the palace walls. I have ordered a city wide search for the assassin, and doubled my guard once again. I know it's the treacherous King of Hungary. The tides will turn for them, Allah is my guide.

[**28th October 1206:**](http://min.us/lLt446yARkBL5) 

I cannot say a lot. My foot is killing me, the infection spreading. Yesterday, I was sparring with my partner, trying to increase my understanding of fighting, when he swung too low and I could not block fast enough. He swung too hard and instead of causing a bruise, the sword cut straight through my leg, dismembering it at the shin. The devil responsible for this has been blinded and castrated, and is awaiting public execution in a week. The fever is too much, I cannot say more. I feel like I am going to die. Leave me, now. Thank you for writing my words. You can stop now, you blustering idio

[**21st November 1206:**](http://min.us/llqIXCrFE3RSg) 

I woke up two days ago from a deep sleep. Apparently, I was found collapsed in my study, head buried in this book. I can barely eat, and writing is taking all of my strength. I got word today that 7000 more of our men have died in another battle. I half wish I died in the deep sleep. According to my doctors, it is natural for my body to do that after such shock. I must sleep now, I am so tired.

[**19th December 1206:**](http://min.us/lMJCo0jpi5140) 

With all that has happened, I have neglected my sons education. He is six years old now, and it is customary that he begin being taught in the ways of diplomacy, war, money and murder. I have decided that I am strong enough to educate my son myself, as I am strong enough to speak at length. My foot still blazes hotter than the fires of hell, but I must be strong for my son. I don't want to die.

[**28th December 1206:**](http://min.us/ll6WeGIsxMp5v) 

Another daughter. Does Allah laugh upon me, and think me a fool? I have only been blessed with two sons, one a bastard. Another daughter in a string of bad events. What have I ever done to anger the lord? We have named her Gunduz.

[**4th January 1207:**](http://min.us/lB3qchyzX7i88) 

The army is gone. The entire horde, every single man, dead. Now the Hungarians lay waste to my lands, unstoppable in their raiding. Why did I ever start this war? I was content with my lands. I thought that the war would bring glory and honour, but it has only brought sadness and hate for my rule. I wanted the people to love me, now they laugh at me.

[**22 February 1207:**](http://min.us/leaygcD5MWzze) 

I have decided to spare my people more suffering, and surrender to Hungary. The deal includes me paying a large 800 pieces of gold to Hungary for their war efforts, and great shame upon my family. I am truly the worst Abdeddit to ever rule. I'm sorry, my son, if you ever read this. I have left you surrounded in a sea of enemies, with the throne in debt. You must bring glory back to the Abdeddit name. For the sake of Allah.

[**10th March 1207:**](http://min.us/lbvt85QK77AGM6) 

Usury is a sin. I know this, yet I commit it. It is a personal sacrifice I must commit in order for the throne to rebuild. I owe great debt to the Hungarians and to my friends, and I am scared of once again invoking the wrath of the Hungarian devils. I have taken a loan of 200 gold for five years from various banks and money lenders.

[**22nd May 1207:**](http://min.us/lHQLwPd4n7lzF) 

I fear my time is near. I have failed my ancestors, I have failed my father, I have failed my children: but ultimately I have failed myself. I have made a mockery of the Abdeddit name, turning it from something to be feared to something to be laughed at. I have not lost any land, but if I should die soon, I will leave my son in a terrible position. I am a cripple and courtiers snigger behind my back. My entire life I have been a coward and a craven, and through trying to disprove what is true I have led to the death of thousands. I'm sorry, peasants.
I'm sorry son.


[**Realms Map**](http://min.us/ltIgVot5Sa5Fc)

Wait, 61% decadence? We're not really going to kick *that* can down the road unaddressed, are we?

***Recovered letter from Sultan Saruca Abdeddit, to his son and heir, Sultan Kobyak II:***

Son, if you receive this, it means I have died before you were old enough for me to tell you personally. I have left you in a bad position, one that will probably lead to the fracturing of the empire. Not only this, but the coffers are damn near empty and you are a very young boy. My advice would be: don't fight the Hungarians. I thought I was strong enough to face them, but apparently not. Move south, and expand down there. You shouldn't take much advice from me, but that's all I have to say. I'm so sorry it ended up like this. I love you dearly. Your hardships will only lead to a harder ruler. Be smart, stay alive. Don't fight Hungary, fight Poland. Spend your money making people like you, you're going to need it.

It's those Holy Orders. Catholics are basically unbeatable now that they've all been unlocked.
