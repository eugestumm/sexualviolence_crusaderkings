Make powerful allies via marriage ( especially important early when you are at your weakest). Build provincial improvements with the cash you generate in peacetime to get a stable cash flow. Rely on your levies initially adding men at arms as your cash flow allows. When at war siege everything for prisoners so that you can ransom them off or recruit them to your court if they are a good knight. Focus on the stewardship tree if you have a good candidate. Wash rinse repeat until you obtain empire of desired size.
