[ACCIDENTALLY TURNED RANT HALFWAY THROUGH] My only wish for this game: replace Hungarian cultural units with something else

Nationalist rant, because why the heck not.

**EDIT**: Turned more rantish-ramblingish than I was expecting it to be. Welp. Enjoy your pseudo-historial lesson.

&nbsp;

So, basically, let's ignore the fact that Hussars first appear about 4 years before the game ends and the actual light cavalry that existed alongside the Black Army of Mathias Corvinus that we nowadays call "Hussars" are only finally called thataway in 1481. Depending on the DLCs you've got, that's only, like, 400-700 years off. Though it makes me wonder what cultural unit we got in EU4. Never played that game.

&nbsp;

But the Poles, Pomerania and Bohemia (these latter two had Hussars??) also get these retinues, if I recall correctly. Why. I dunno about the latter two, but Polish Hussars first appear in the 1500s or so, and they're literally only Hussars in name.

&nbsp;

Y'see, the word "Huszár" has "husz" in it. That's because for every 20 lot ("húsz" = 20 in Hungarian), you had to have a peasant to sign up for the light cavalry. You ain't gonna waste shit on peasants! Slap 'em with a horse and tell 'em to run around in circles heckling the opposition. So, they were light cavalry.

&nbsp;

Polish Hussars were also more heavily armoured shock cavalry, and were mostly made up by nobles. Also, the most iconic military unit of the Kingdom of Poland was a Hungarian one that exists for four years. Jolly good show.

&nbsp;

No wonder the AI can't perform a simple Honfoglalás. It's asking its vassals for shit that doesn't even exist yet:

&nbsp;

"Alright, Marshall, prepare the men. Call forth the light cavalry. For every twentieth lot you see, bring a peasant to battle."

"Very well, my gyula, but what's a lot? And, uh, 'Marshall'?"

"SUCH INSOLENCE! YOU WILL NOW ADRESS ME AS KHAN!"

"Kh- I mean, uh, okay, I guess? But seriously, why? And anyways, where is the kende-"

"I RULE IN THE TRIBE OF MAGYARS, ALONE!"

"'Tribe'? But we literally named this shit 'Sevenmagyars', because, y'know, seven tribes-"

"I'M SICK OF YOUR BULLSHIT, YOU'RE GOING TO THE OUBLIETTE"

"The what now- HELP, ÁLMOS'S GONE ABSOLUTELY BONKERS!"

&nbsp;

^((Yes, yes, it is not known what type of high prince Álmos was, kende [sacred ruler] or gyula [military leader], but from a gameplay perspective, we're most likely a gyula as Álmos. Plus going from the fact that the game doesn't allow theocracies or dual monarchies, and that "Kündür" [Khazar version, most likely the inspiration for the kende title] is a minor title [...for every Tengri ruler...], we're definitely playing as a gyula.)^)

&nbsp;

Anyway, my suggestion-slash-wish is that the Hungarian retinue be replaced with horse archer based one. Why? Because the fact that we also did the horseback feigned retreating thingy that the Huns a few hundred years before us was basically the reason we were mistaken for the Huns and are still called Hungarians.

Alternatively, make the even troops these type of horse archers, but give no cultural retinue for the Hungarians. There are no famous "special troops" for Hungarians during this time period that I could name at the top of my head, and we could live the surprise mass arrow-rape tactics for the Altaic culture.

&nbsp;

Am I done? I think I am. Welp, off to sleep.

...And also, give them Poles some actual Polish stuff.


>And also, give them Poles some actual Polish stuff. 

So generic medieval retinue (1 knight, 499 peasants)?

Horse Archers are pretty garbage though.  
Especially if you're sticking around as nomads.  
Pure LC is far superior.  


But horse archers are terrible. Why do you want to screw the Hungarians over?

You had me at, "adress me as khan".

Polish Hussar best.

Check the Serbs.We get Gusars (kind of a predecessors of the Hussars),and other south slavs get it even though when you build gusar training grounds it clearly says that they are Serbian so why do other South slavs get them too?

Why dont Lithuanians get hussars too?

Historically we had hussars, but if everybody has hussars who would be unique? 

Instead we get Baltic warrior heavy infantry retinue, standart defense retinue is better tough :/

I hate how people refer people that lived on the same plot of land 1000 years ago as their ancestors when most have no connection to them.  Fuck cultural nationalism, it's an outdated invention from the 1800's and i am quite frankly balls tired of it. And is the Hungarians not strong enough already? Horse archers can be overkill considering their strenght.
