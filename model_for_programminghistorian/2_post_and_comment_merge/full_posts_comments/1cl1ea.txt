**The diary of King Henry 'the Vainglorious' d'Isigny**, *as written by /u/NoroSteve*



**4th December 1168**



 



I am [king](http://i.imgur.com/pqZuMPi.jpg) Henry of Syria, my Reign begins now.  Although my house has risen to bask in a vast amount of glory, I will rise up to become the greatest ruler of all time.  As I am writing, I can already see the kingdom that I am going to carve out appear before my eyes.  This is my time, my rule, and I demand greatness.



 



In order to prepare for the wars that I will ultimately wage at some point, I have spend a vast amount of [gold](http://i.imgur.com/rvZBSNK.jpg) on the retinues that I have employed.  My Marshall tells me that we can now afford to hire 4500 men, I have ordered him to immediately get to work hiring these soldiers, my vast kingdom isn't going to create itself.



 



**21st January 1169**



 



My son Henry emerged from the dungeon with a bloody knife today.  Upon investigation, it appears that my son had managed to carve the skin off of one of the chained up prisoners arm.  He was lucky he wasn't hurt.  What surprised me even more is that, upon taking to him about what he had done, I got the feeling that he seemed to enjoy causing that man pain.  I fear henry will continue down this [cruel](http://i.imgur.com/RY9Hh70.jpg) path.



 



**10th March 1169**



 



I was informed today that there is a [band of robbers](http://i.imgur.com/kG6Shf7.jpg) roaming the countryside in Tell Bashir.  The peasants are running scared.  These fools!  I will cut off all of their heads!  If only they realised what they have started; I have ordered a man hunt for these thieves, and I will make to sure to make an example of these fools.  No one steals from my people and gets away with it!



 



**7th April 1169**



 



My wife sat me down today to inform me of her [pregnancy!](http://i.imgur.com/L8TaM3C.jpg)  Glorious news!  I am hoping for a son, so that I can train him in the art of warfare.  I can already see the man that he will become, a vicious knight who rules with an iron fist!



 



**15th April 1169**



 



The sultanate of Egypt is in turmoil, civil wars plague the land.  I have taken this opportunity to [declare war](http://i.imgur.com/eXGRStN.jpg) on one of rebelling vassals.  This is the start of my kingdom, first I take Jerusalem, and then the rest of Egypt’s unholy leaders will fall under my might!



 



**10th May 1169**



 



Although it has taken me some time to sent the letters, I have received word that the full might of my army is riding towards the capital.  We shall amass as one unbeatable force, and the storm frail city of Jerusalem.  My glory is coming, I can see it, my name shall live forever, King Henry 'The Great' of Syria they shall call me before long!



 



**14th May 1169**



 



My chancellor, along with my Marshall arrived in my chambers today.  They seemed surprised that I was not dressed, and simply lying in bed, bah, I am the king, if I want to lye in bed all day then that is exactly what I will do!  Upon getting dressed, I was informed that my war can no longer be carried out, due to a [liege change](http://i.imgur.com/gAEUcpp.jpg) on Jerusalem!  How could this have happened, the civil war was over so quick!  I simply cannot wait for another civil war to break out to seize my opportunity for greatness!



 



There shall be other wars I suppose, at least I can relax and enjoy life for the next couple of weeks.



 



**27th May 1169**



 



A glorious thing has occurred!  The pope must have heard about my lost cause of a war!  He has called a [crusade for Jerusalem!](http://i.imgur.com/DbWVGhK.jpg)  This is my chance, why take a small part of Jerusalem, when I can have the entire kingdom!  This is it, my kingdom of Syria is finally happening, in a few years time I shall have the mightiest kingdom the world has ever seen!



 



**30th August 1169**

 



Just as my troops were amassing near my capital, I was handed a letter, straight from my good friend the emperor!  He wants me to join in on a [holy war](http://i.imgur.com/Z4qayHd.jpg), fine, I will send him a letter informing him of acceptance of this offer; I shall not however, be giving him any troops.  They are already moving one direction, why on earth would I move them in another, that’s a lot more walking than I think I want to do!



 



**6th November 1169**



 



Just as my troops finished amassing outside of the capital, I have been informed that my wife has given birth in another part of the castle!  [I have a daughter!](http://i.imgur.com/528LHyV.jpg)  I can already imagine all of the great things that this baby girl will achieve in her long and healthy life!  She will marry a great ruler, and we shall carve out an empire!  Such as great day!



 



**2nd January 1170**



 



It pained me to leave my home, my wife, my children, but the war demands it, it would not be right to join a crusade and not march into battle.  We have been [marching](http://i.imgur.com/tGhSu4P.jpg) for a long time, so long that I have grown incredibly tired from walking.  I will no longer be marching with my men, to hell with the morale, the king is tired, and the king does what he wants!  I will ride a horse from now on.  One of the side flank leaders told me that my men are starving, but what do I care?  We will still arrive in Jerusalem with an unbeatable force!  If the men starve, then they deserve death for being so useless!



 



**28th January 1170**



 



We have arrived in battle!  A fierce fight has broken out!  I am cutting down men left and right!  Although their faces look grim as I cut them down, they should rest easy that they have had the pleasure to die by the hands of a Christian!  Although I care little for religion, I am still catholic, and these infidels should fear my might!



One of the infidels managed to [hit me](http://i.imgur.com/PH3qFlN.jpg) with a warhammer, such a barbaric weapon!  Although I have been telling my men that the blow I have received is only minor, I can fell the breath leave me every time I swing at a man, I fear that I been wounded!



 



**3rd February 1170**



 



6 days of fighting, and it is finally over.  My Marshall tells me that we have suffered incredibly minor losses, not even losing a tenth of our men, glorious!  We were joined by the king of England during the middle of the battle, it was glorious, a [battle to remember!](http://i.imgur.com/tm4PXUh.jpg)



 



**5th April 1170**



 



I have received word that the [betrothal](http://i.imgur.com/T5SR5Ov.jpg) has been finalised.  My son will marry the daughter of the kingdom of Sicily.  This alliance will merge our two great houses, and allow the both of us to carve out a magnificent kingdom!



 



I have also given the order for my men to [move to another province](http://i.imgur.com/hg3ayty.jpg), having two armies stationed here at the same time is proving unwise, 3 thousand of my men have starved while we sit here and hope that we can breach the walls!  3 thousand men dead for nothing!  How am I supposed to carve out a magnificent kingdom with 3 thousand rotting corpses?  Such a waste!



 



**15th June 1170**



 



As we are moving to the Provence of Acre, I spotted what appeared to be a 600 man army amassing outside of the city walls.  I ordered my men to surround the army.  14 thousand men surrounding 600.  There were no talks of peace.  This was a message to all those who oppose me.  [It was a slaughter](http://i.imgur.com/yY5iQuy.jpg), and I hope there are many more before this crusader is over.



 



**13th August 1170**



 


The wound that I suffered all that time ago has finally healed, leaving a [pretty nasty scar](http://i.imgur.com/s2MB2Xe.jpg).  I remember the man who gave me this wound in the first place.  I remember his face when he realised that he has left his side open in the process, I remember sticking my sword straight into his pathetic body.  Warhammers are viscous weapons, when you know how to use them.



 



**15th September 1170**



 



I fell as though my army has been outside of Acre for decades.  We have achieved little, caused a disturbance here and there, cutting off food supplies, but we do not seem to be making a dent in the walls.  I received word that the soldiers of Acre are [starving](http://i.imgur.com/vtRda5s.jpg) due to the lack of food.  Good.  The sooner they all starve to death, the sooner we can get to the killing, sacking and burning of this pathetic excuse for a city.



 



I have also sent word to the capital to inform them that I seek to enforce [Larger feudal taxes](http://i.imgur.com/ThgutfQ.jpg) than those that are currently in place.  How am I supposed to keep an army going without money?  This is a sacrifice that the realm with have to deal with, glory is all I case about.



 



**22nd September 1170**



 



Anger such as this is something that I have not felt in an incredibly long time.  I felt as though my blood was leaking from my veins as I read the letter that was handed to me.  “It is time for you to recognise the full [independence](http://i.imgur.com/oYZ44GA.jpg) of Aleppo and the other states in the independence faction.  Be reasonable and let us not resort to bloodshed”.  I am the king of Syria, and if this traitorous filth wants independence, then they are going to have to fight I, the great king Henry, as well as my allies.  This will end in bloodshed, you can be assured of that, I am your King!  You owe me allegiance!  You will suffer greatly for this, pain you could not possibly comprehend is coming your way!



 



**13th October 1170**



 



My troops are occupied in the crusade, they will not be moving from this city, until my men have shed copious amounts of blood from this filthy place.  The emperor has agreed to [join my war](http://i.imgur.com/GEi0hUn.jpg), this wretched woman cannot hope to fight both me, and the Byzantine Emperor at the same time can she?  What a fool!  I need not waste a single man on this pathetic rebellion.



 



**24th February 1171**



 



I grow tired with this siege, I lost perhaps 4 thousand men while assaulting this pathetic city, I grew tired of the siege, but my god did the men make up for the dead, they must have raped, killed and burned their way through the entire length of the city!



 



Although the sack of the city was a great one, I have received a letter.  The last letter I received announced a rebellion, so I can only hope that this one will announce the end of the rebellion, or something along the lines of good news.



[Another rebellion](http://i.imgur.com/8GRTGLM.jpg).  Duke Wymund seeks to claim the kingdom of Mesopotamia.  I completely forgot about that title, but I suppose it holds some sort of value to this pathetic man.  Fine, if he wishes to go to war, then so be it.  When I win, he shall be blinded, tortured, killed.  Then, I will gather up his children, and do the same to them, his friends will meet the same fate, his wife, anyone he has ever loved with suffer my wroth! 



 



**23rd March 1171**



 



My son Henry grows [ambitious](http://i.imgur.com/Oa6uWUb.jpg).  Good, at least someone has the sense to want greatness.  It has also come to my attention that Duke Wymund has called Duke Serlo of Tigris into this pathetic war.  I cannot deal with this!  I have such a lack of men, only 4 thousand remain after this crusade!  How on earth am I supposed to fight off two rebellions at once?!  I can already feel my heart beating faster than I know it should.  We march for Syria.  Hopefully I can end this rebellion and kill this traitor before he manages to damage the kingdom any further.  I will have to carve out the greatest kingdom the world has ever seen another day.



 



**11 September 1171**



 



I have arrived in the lands of the [great independence faction](http://i.imgur.com/cMR5JBd.jpg).  I can already see that they posed a tremendous threat to the great kingdom of Syria.  What a pointless war, lost before it begun I think.  The countess will be tortured, passed around between the men, and suffer a humiliating death.  A shame, this need to happen if she simply accepted my rule and continued on with her pathetic life.



 



**11th December 1171**



 



The countess [surrenders](http://i.imgur.com/k6LwKQL.jpg), the duchy of Allepo will once again become part of the kingdom of Syria, and the troops will be joined to mine.  Just in time as well, as I see the other rebellious men marching towards me.  They will die, they do not realise it yet, but they are walking into a slaughter.  One rebellion down, one to go.



 



**30th December 1171**



 



As the rebellious army marches towards the capital, my men, as well as my the new additions to my army, [amass outside of the capital](http://i.imgur.com/RIXtxoW.jpg).  This coming battle will decide the fate of the realm.  While they starve on their march, I will be hiring men to join the retinue of my soldiers.  This is a battle already victorious.



 



**18th February 1171**



 



I have received word that the [band of robbers](http://i.imgur.com/A873X69.jpg) that were plaguing the lands of Tell Bashir have been rounded up.  Brought before me, they suffered miserable deaths, and their heads and sitting nicely on a spike, as a message to all those who oppose me.



 



**4th March 1172**



 



I had not seen my wife in years since I joined the crusade.  Although it pains me to leave her once more, I must.  I was surprised at how big my new daughter had grown.  I will get to know her better when I return from battle.  The rebellious army have starved to the point where they have decided to besiege some city which holds little to no value in the kingdom of Syria.  My army has amassed, and we ride to battle, victory awaits us, [victory awaits my men!](http://i.imgur.com/JnKd44G.jpg)



 



**1st May 1172**



 



[We are victorious!](http://i.imgur.com/QqzEQGq.jpg)  A horrific battle, it was glorious.  We lost almost 3000 men, while they lost 4000.  At this point, we have the advantage, how long do they think that can keep on?  They have lost half of their army!  This is truly a pathetic rebellion, one which I will crush with the mighty weight of my boot.

***Continued below...***


***Continued from above...***



 



**15th July 1172**



 



We followed the retreating rebels for quite some time, killing off the stragglers, or the wounded who were left behind while the main army was running with all their might, hoping to avoid the fate of their fallen brothers.  They brought this on themselves, they were my men at one point, the ambitions of a petty lord caused their deaths.  Earlier today, we caught up with their entire army, and slaughtered every single one of them.  The death toll of just over a [thousand for the rebels](http://i.imgur.com/GoYirvr.jp ).  They have no army, no men to fight for them, how can they possibly hope to continue this lost cause?



 



**18th June 1173**



 



The war campaign continues.  It has been some time since I have been in a fight, I have been otherwise occupied.  Small dealings here and there, establishing alliances along the way.  I have spent almost a year with my wife and daughter since the slaughter at Asas.  My daughter is lovely, oh how she grows each and every day.  Although I have council members telling me about the war, I do not worry, the duke has no men, how can he possibly be a threat to me now?  But they are right, I must end this, I have ordered the armies of Syria to [amass outside the capital](http://i.imgur.com/clr09Wu.jpg) once again.  We will march to the lands of the traitor, siege the walls, and drag him from his pathetic castle.  It shall be a long march, but I must be there to see the man who has caused the deaths of so many.  My men have fallen in this rebellion, men I have grown up with, shared drinks with; I still see their faces when I sleep at night.  You can have all the sword training in the world, but war is something that you can never be prepared for until you experience it.  Although I do some day plan of carving out a kingdom, I must end this rebellion, and then march for Jerusalem.



 



**15th September 1173**



 



When the ally of Duke Wymund showed his ugly head, we were there to greet him.  3500 troops against 11 thousand.  We march to battle, and hopefully for the last time. 



 



I can see the army on the horizon, young men, scared, they didn't sign up for this, they have families that they will never see again, all because of the ambition of one man!  We march men, we run to battle, the last great battle of this foolish rebellion!



 



As battle commenced, I spotted a large man who was slaughtering my troops as they marched towards him!  Not any more I thought as I ran his way; After he was done fighting multiple men, he turned to me, as though he was aware of my presence the entire time.  “I've never killed a King before”, he said, as he readied his sword, “No”, I muttered back at this mountain of a man, “And you will not get the chance”.  It felt as though we were fighting for an incredibly long time, but in the end, my sword proved true.  As I ducked under the unwise swing of his sword, I quickly unsheathed my small dagger, and jumped on the man the second I could.



As I wrestled him to the ground, stabbing him as I go, I could see the life drain from his eyes.  As I stood up, victorious, and watching my men fight the enemy army with impressive strength and will, I heard a shout.



 



“Watch out, Your Grace!”.  It was too late, I turned around, [only to be smacked in the face by a large warhammer.](http://i.imgur.com/xfoCvjq.jpg)



 



**24th September 1173**



 



The battle of saint Symeon is over, [we have won](http://i.imgur.com/1Ndrwji.jpg).  But at a great cost, I, the king of Syria, have been injured beyond repair.  I shall wait out my days a bedridden and useless man, I am incapable.



 



**5th December 1173**



 



My wife sat with me today, although I could not look at her, I understood all of which she was telling me.  My army moves for the [enemies capital](http://i.imgur.com/zcwM0yE.jpg).  I feel sad, so incredibly sad.  I will never have the chance to see my children grow older, never be their for their wedding, never be there to hold my grandchildren, never be able to make love to my wife.  This war, this war has stolen everything from me.



 



I am not long for this world.  I welcome death perhaps I will be reunited with all of the men that I have killed.  I deserve this.  I wanted to carve out the greatest kingdom the world has ever seen, and now, now I am destined to be forgotten, and be remembered as the man who lay in his bed, waiting for death.



 



**16th February 1174**



 



My wife sat with me again today.  I do love having her near me in my final days.  I have been lying here for months, unable to move, slowly moving towards the black gates of hell.  I am told that the rebellion is over.  The Hizirid Sultanate has seen fit to [steal the lands](http://i.imgur.com/JfHmrYt.jpg) that belonged to Duke Wymund.  I hope you are happy, Wymund, you landless filth, you have brought dishonor to the kingdom of Syria.



 



**6th March 1174**



 



My son sat with me today, I think is name is Henry, or is that my name?  Whoever he was, he told me that 16 thousand men are marching towards some place called [Jerusalem](http://i.imgur.com/ovt4k0H.jpg), to take back the holy land.  I didn't know what that meant, but he sounded happy about it, so I suppose I should be happy also.



 



**15th April 1174**



 



My life.  My whole life I have sought after glory, and in the end, I fractured the kingdom of Syria.  I am King Henry of Syria, and my death is near.  I can only hope that my son will not make the same mistakes that I have made, bring glory to the kingdom son, bring glory to the kingdo...



 



[**King Henry, the first of his name, is dead!**](http://i.imgur.com/PICbqig.jpg)

Anybody have any good ideas for what we should nickname King Henry I? I've been trying to nickname everyone, even if the game doesn't provide one.

So far we have:

* Count Talbot *'the Possessed'*

* King Serlo *'the Holy'*

* and King Talbot *'the Forgettable'*

Someone should rename the provinces to european ones.
