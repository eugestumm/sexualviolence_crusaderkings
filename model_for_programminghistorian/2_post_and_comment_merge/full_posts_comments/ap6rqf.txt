I know I'm being gang raped, but I'm still concerned about your political affiliation...



R5: Twenty years ago a child of destiny appeared and started what seemed like Greek and Orthodox renaissance in the region that was dominated by Tengris for 200 years. Now his descendants are losing ground, rapidly. One of Tengri realms obtained a child of destiny of their own, and this young Greek realm is about to get screwed. So I generously decide to assist Greece. But no! "Political concerns!" What are you concerned about, damn it?! Are you not concerned about Tengris taking your lands from all sides?!

I definitely would like to see a time of need modifier to the political thing for alliances. Like "we are losing a war so we need to do this or else we get butt raped"
