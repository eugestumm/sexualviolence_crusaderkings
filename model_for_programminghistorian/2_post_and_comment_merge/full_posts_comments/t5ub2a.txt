**Edit**: removed a couple of stuff

Her father Ormr, a well respected warrior that had served chief Rognvald's father and now served him faithfully in Nidaros, was desperate for a child, but he and his wife Eyvor had very though luck, and now approching 50 years of age, the chances of giving birth to a heir were slim. Nevertheless, her mother prayed to Freja every night, offering to the goddess even her own flesh in exchange for a kid for his beloved husband.

After an year, they found a reason to rejoy: Eyvor was pregnant! The woman's belly grew and grew, and on a cold winter night, the baby was being born. However, the childbirth was complicated, and the poor Eyvor suffered from heavy blood losses, that caused her to die within a few weeks. Ormr found himself alone with a newborn child, and went above and beyond to give her the best life he could.

The young Vigdis grew strong and beautiful, becoming rapidly famous in the chiefdom for her exceptional size, towering almost a foot among her peers, that convinced the old warrior that she could become a part of the chief's household, even though they were part of the lower classes, if she could prove her worth in battle.

Therefore, they trained and trained, one day after the other, and when she was sixteen, he petitioned to have her join the shieldwall. The chief was hesitant, but her abilities and peculiar phisicality won his favor, and so she was employed in the next raid.

Unfortunately, the raid went poorly, the raiding party was cornered, and to save his life, the chief fled on one of the boat, leaving most of the warriors behind, including Vigdis.

Vigdis fought desperately, and he and a few others were able to fend off the attackers and recover one of the boats, making their way towards home.

When they returned, and Ormr learned what had happened, he was furios, claiming that a chief that left for dead a girl that was placed in his custody was unworthy of his title, and challenged him for an Holmgang, to avenge his misdeeds. Being almost 70 however, he had lost almost all of his ability to fight, barely able to hold his trusty shield, and so the young giantess offered to take his place, saying that she would defend the Austmadr's name, even if they were just farmers.

The chief agreed to fight, thinking that a woman, while big, would not have a chance in a fight against a real man and warrior like him. Boy, was he wrong. She fought fiercely, parrying most of the man's blows and hitting his shield with the strenght of a dozen men, and before long, Rognvald yielded, a broken arm and an even worse spirit.

"I will spare your life, Rognvald, but you will have to leave Nidaros and never return " she said "If i ever see you again in these shores, i will crush your skull"

The ex-chief fled, leaving the town the next day, and given that his  only son had died the year before, the Assembly chose her as the new Chieftess, convinced that the gods had given her those qualities for a reason, and that her victory was the proof that she was the one to rule them.

And so she ruled, alongside her father, for a few months, until, at the end of a particularly cold autumn, the old warrior become ill with pneumonia, dying a few weeks later.

In his dying bed, she promised him that she would make him proud, that she would make their name great, and promised to her maidens that she would never allow a woman under her rule to be disrespected as she was, whatever it will take.

Hope you like it :), i'm excited to see what this absolute specimen of a woman will do (For anyone wondering, i'm playing with Oneproud bavarian's Ultimate immersion mods, + the Giant No Face Edit mod)

Unfortunately, old Chief Rognvald was more interested in her other "assets", and when they embarked on a ship to raid in Ireland, the chief tried to rape her, and she was saved only by the sudden coming of an heavy storm, that the ship found itself in.

When they returned, and Ormr learned what had happened, he was furios, claiming that a chief that tried to bed a girl that was placed in his custody was unworthy of his title, and challenged him for an Holmgang, to reclaim his and his daughter's pride.
