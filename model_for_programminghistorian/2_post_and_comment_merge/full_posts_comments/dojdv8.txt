I really don’t want to rape my husband.

So I formed the Ghiskari Empire as Empress Daenarys and married a no body to grant him titles and have a powerful vassal as slave, but he is “Celibate” and I can’t get them to fuck already so he don’t usurp the empire from my first daughter that is heir to the Kingdom of Mereen but not the Empire because she is a legitimazed bastard, and I don’t really like that poor fuck but I don’t want to imprison him just to rape him in the dungeons and them have him killed, he is a powerful vassal so this could break some fragile diplomacy I got going, I just want to have a baby from him and them burn him as a apostate in the name of R’hollor.. Please help me, I’ve even being trying to cuck him for years with almost everybody in the Empire but no one likes me because of mass murder of some shit like that, anyway, do someone know any way that I can seduce him into bed or anything ? Even raping without the imprisonment, pls, I really don’t want a another stressful problem in dragon’s bay. (If anyone can help about the cuckold part also, the making the fool fall for it I can handle, but actually having some chad to cuck my husband with is the complex part)

*reads the post*

We have reached peak Crusader Kings.

My life is all downhill from here.

If you invite new people to the court with the decision they won't hate you as they weren't around when you did ~~regrettable~~ necessary things.  Then bang them.

If he's got Celibate trait even if you did rape him he wouldn't impregnate you as it gives a massive fertility debuff.  


Better off cucking or killing him.

And people say Daenarys went mad in season 8. D&D should've read this sub.

Wow...wow...
I'm lack of words...
...wow...
