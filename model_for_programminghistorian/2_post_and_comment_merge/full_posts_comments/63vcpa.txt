[Problem] My viking ships are heaving with gold but are stuck in the Rhine. Help me please.

Hey its me again with a new problem. So I sailed down the Rhine to rape and pillage the weak Prince-Bishoprics like any self-respecting viking, but now my ships are stuck in the last segment of the Rhine.


By stuck I mean they wont move at all and none of my other fleets can reach them either. 340 gold worth of loot down the drain if I cant save it.


By Odin, please help me!

The rhine is navigable only in certain times of the year.

Just wait a while and try again
