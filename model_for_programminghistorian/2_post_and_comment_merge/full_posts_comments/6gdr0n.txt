Will vassal holy orders join factions against you?

So I got jerusalem from the first crusade ever that i joined and i found out that you can vassalize templars and hospitallers if you own jerusalem. I proceeded to do that and i gave them ascalon and galilee respectively but Idk if that was a smart thing to do lol. So do they also conspire against their liege/revolt/proceed to rape your counties with their stacks like nomal vassals do? Cause ive read that they can only do holy wars or sthng like that. And should I have not given them land and instead just left them with their titular titles? 

Yes, leave them unlanded. They will join factions now.

Yes they do. But there is no reason why you should ever disband them after you summon them. Treat them as free retinues, and from experience, having this deathstack often discourages vassals from revolting.

I get cancer every time the defensive pagan holy orders join factions, because getting a non-aggression pact with them is difficult.
