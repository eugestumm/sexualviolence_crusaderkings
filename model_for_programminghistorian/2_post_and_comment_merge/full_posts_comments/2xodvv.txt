Given my current position, am I at risk of getting raped by the mongols? First time getting this far and they just started spawning



You will not, because the Mongol threat in the recent patches has been akin to that of a small, neutered puppy. They'll take one kingdom and then sit there.

I mean, look at the timelapse a few posts below. It starts in 1241, where the Mongols have large stacks and established kingdoms, and the Caliph managed to conquer Persia from the Ilkhans in a few short years. They're absurdly portrayed at the moment- and this is ignoring the plain wrong chronological errors in the bookmarks and the whole mess of their succession laws.

You should be fine, I'd suggest expanding into Scandinavia to avoid the Mongols, going east or south might complicate things. 

Generally yes, from the Golden Horde, in most games I've seen they get as far as ruthenia and then stop. But you might get lucky. However as you're so far north it seems unlikely you would be at much risk.
