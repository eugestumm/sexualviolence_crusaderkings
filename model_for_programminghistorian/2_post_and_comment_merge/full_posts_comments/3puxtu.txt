How To Keep Vikings Away

So I started in the Charlemagne DLC year of 700 something as the petty king of Mercia. It wasn't hard to wage war and conquer most of Wales and Scotland, and England is completely under my control.

Anyways now its the viking age of the year 806 and every 2 days a new viking horde of 200 phaggots raid my territory. Its more of a nuisance than it is a threat. What I want to know is, how do I keep these narwhale fuckers from raiding me and raping my sweet virgin daughters? I keep executing the captures phucks but they just keep coming.

This happens to everyone at the start of the viking age. You just have to follow these three simple steps and you'll survive:

Step 1 - unbelt pantaloons
