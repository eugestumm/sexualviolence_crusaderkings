Strange observation or is it just me?

It's so easy to lose but at the same time after you successfully make your way up and have few cadet branches it's almost impossible to fail. In ck2 certain starts were very hard, for example that castrated guy in iberia - doable but based on luck, right now a certain amount of characters is doomed. Tried to recreate my fav ck2 playthrough, 867 sicilian muslilm -> greek orthodox emperor of italy and north africa but got smashed 3 times. A) to convert you need piety and to get it you either: win holy wars ( small levies ), do pilgrimages ( low income ) B) my liege 2 out of 3 times declared independence war that he lost + each time my heir died due to sieges C) Byzantine/Italian holy wars almost immediately D) norse raiders paradropping all over mediterranean stealing gold and you or/and your heirs. Same goes for pretty much all opm in norse range, these guys just declare county/duchy conquest all over the world, if you are unlucky the savage horde is going to rape and plunder or even the other way around.

Something does feel off, your not alone. I've just been chalking it up to a balancing issue/lack of features from the dlc that make hard problems have solutions. Ive had a strange issue where my heir goes independent out of no where and I lose controle of him (sucks cause he always gets him self killed)

Honestly I disagree on the cadet branch point- I actually had a game over tonight on the lucca dynasty because one of my cadet branches took the throne from me and then unlanded me. 

Ultimately I actually think losing is easier here than it was in CK2, but it comes from the way cadet branches (and family branches as a whole) work. I've never liked the whole "you just follow your heirs" thing, because what can happen is another family branch can fuck you over, and you game over despite it being the same dynasty. 

Sorry, rant over, frustrating game over.
