Screw Catholicism

I sent my 26 intrigue genius heir to steal technology from the capital of the bloody roman empire, and boy were they not happy when they caught him, especially as he was a pagan infidel. So you know what these sick fucks did? THEY CHOP OFF THE DICK OF MY GENIUS HEIR AND SEND HIM BACK TO ME.    this means fucking war. fucking war. I'm going to rape and pillage all of the HRE, I swear to Odin.

I mean, speaking from experience (IG), just pillaging is more useful. Having a bunch of bastards around merely means more adventure claim wars, which are inconvenient as they take time away from proper raiding.

Also, never have your heir (unless you have backups, I guess) doing councilor jobs that put them at risk of being murdered/captured. Ugly way to learn that lesson but perhaps the burned hand keeps the point longer!

Why on earth would you do that?

This is why you only ever put people that you're fine with killing off on the council...as well as why I never accept council jobs from the AI unless it's an advisor job.

Wait, German Catholics can cut off peopleâ€™s manhood as punishment? I thought only Orthodox Greeks could! Time to play the HRE again.

You've learned the hard lesson, never put anyone indispensable as your spymaster. That's the most dangerous council job of them all.

May Odin be with you in this troubling time. This your first time seeing a spymaster get imprisoned, or did you just click the highest number you saw and not see it's your heir?

What kind of idiot do you have to be to send your genius heir somewhere he can be arrested?
