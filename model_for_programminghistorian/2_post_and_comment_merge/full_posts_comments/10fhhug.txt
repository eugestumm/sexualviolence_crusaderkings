Why is my wife okay with me raping women but raises a stink if I seduce them first?

Minor complaint, but I tend to try and Seduce women with good traits to have them over as my Concubines. Most of the time, I can invite them and ask for conversion before any infidelity is revealed. Rarely, I'm caught right after the end of the seduction scheme, and I get branded an Adulterer for laying with a woman that's already mine. What gives? It really feels like there should be more of a grace period if you seduce a woman to make her your concubine after inviting. It could even be an option to make her a concubine directly before she joins your court, with her being a willing concubine.

Not a huge problem but it's been annoying in more games than one so I felt I should point this out.

I should think this would be obvious but in cultures/faiths with concubinage it's expected that  a ruler will have concubines for breeding purposes. If you're laying with a woman who isn't a concubine (yet) then of course your wife is going to be angry about it, since you're indulging in sex outside the parameters allowed by your culture/faith.

I don't know the reason but I do think it's a bit weird. One reason I could think of would be that being lovers is viewed as being more intimate.

Instead of giving you a free pass for adultery if you make an honest woman out of her afterward, I'd attack this annoyance from the other direction. Add a "wants to marry for love" relationship type (with a corresponding variation on the seduction scheme) that adds invite and marriage acceptance and unlocks the elope scheme as if you were lovers, but without the actual adultery.

I've never had that problem. Is your intrigue nonexistent? I constantly seduce women, usually to have them make artifacts, but I never have the secret revealed between then and inviting them.

Just reform with "male adultery: accepted" doctrine.
