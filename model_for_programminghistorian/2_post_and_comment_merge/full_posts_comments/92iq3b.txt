Need some help kidnapping and raping the pope

So ive been playing as a female character whose killed hundreds of people by now so naturally i decided to capture and rape the pope, but really im not sure how.

First problem is how do i rape people, i would assume i need a mod but im not sure which one

Second problem is even if i am able to get the pope and have a rape mod, could i even do it? Im not sure if females could rape the pope, or even if capturing the pope by raiding is even possible.

There is a mod to rape prisoners but for the life of me I can't remember what it's called and the really wild stuff is in a nonSteam version because of the Workshop rules. You'll want to track that down and then use the Intrigue Way of Life decision that allows you to kidnap people (also mods to make this easier). Kidnap the Popeman to your prison and then you can do with him as you wish.

Yes. Some mods allow a entire court to be captured,in case of raiding. Sadly, I don't remember the name

I think a rape prisoners mod is merciless ruler or something like that 

Can female Norse rulers have male Concubines?
