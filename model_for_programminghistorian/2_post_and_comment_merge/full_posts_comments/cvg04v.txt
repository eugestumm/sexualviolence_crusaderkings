Anyone else become extremely good at history and geography due to CK2?

After 900 hours into CK2 I'm extremely good at narrowing down geography in conversations and people think I'm a super genius.  I just explain I've pillaged, raped and looted across every single county in Europe a dozen times so the names are burned into my head.

Yeah I know right this game is great for learning geography

People always act surprised when I tell them Italy is actually in France

damn peasants

People are amazed when I tell them the last Holy Roman Emperor was a Zoroastrian Irishman who died during a failed attempt to become the saoshyant.

You remind me of the time I got talking to a norwegian bus driver in world of warcraft and I knew exactly where his small obscure town was just to the west of oslo: "oh have you been there?" "nah mate it was my fav route to drive my panzers through to grab the airfields north of oslo in panzer general..."

Once was able to pickup a girl because I knew her German hometown.  It's name?  Ulm.  

Ha overall I definitely think CKII and Europa Universalis have gotten me to become better at geography, that and it's fun to look up and read about the various nations and rulers of various regions.

It's definitely helped me learn specific regions of European countries and the names of the more obscure royal houses.

My high school had a foreign exchange student from Spain back when I first started playing CK2 with my friend (me as Castile and my friend as Leon in 1066). The Spaniard and I were both on the Speech team, and one day he was ranting about how bad Americans were at geography. *insert triggered hol ups* 

Spaniard: Where is Oviedo? 

Me: Northern Spain in Asturias. Where is Chicago? 

Spaniard: East Coast? 

Me: ...No.

Americans are good at geography as long as they play unhealthy amounts of video games.

I started CK2 because of my love for history and have been thoroughly enjoying it for almost two years now

geography for sure, history however you can only learn general things, like rough time periods of countries, and a bit more from the start dates

Geography? Yes. History? No, but it has made me look up a lot of things which has helped. Also the different start dates give a sense of historical progression.

I wouldn't say extremely good, but playing as a ruler did make it make sense why some things happened.

I always thought the viceroy system was awful because it incentivised the viceroys to extract as much value as possible from their province while they had their position, instead of planning for long-term growth. When I got to the point where I was playing an emperor I started using viceroyalties because that would prevent my vassals from becoming too powerful, so it makes sense it from the emperor's point of view

I always thought of agnatic succession as deeply unfair, but when I tried to play with Absolute cognactic and my dukes kept easily intermarrying and producing superdukes I quickly realized it needed to be kept down if my dynasty was to keep it's power without having to deal with a ton of civil wars from too powerful ambitious dukes.

I though primogeniture was a stupid and unfair system, but after seeing the bordergore and inevitable civil wars that always follow a gavelkind succession I saw the incentive towards not splitting the inheritance.

Hmm. Well, I am a professional historian... but CK2 nonetheless helped me visualize a lot of stuff. It's not an academic tool, but it's a nice way to supplement more proper research.

Lol I was watching a movie the other day and I was like o dam that’s Mallorca.

My interest in history was ignited by Civilization 1 and the old Svea Rike games that was the first seed for the EU and then CK series. EUII and CK: Deus Vult were my real first teachers about european and world geography. But it's the thousands of hours of reading about history that has made me somewhat knowledgeable on the topic.

These games, i believe, are together with brilliant podcasters like Dan Carlin, Danielle Bolelli, Mike Duncan etc. the two most important parts of why interest of history is on the rise.

I learned about islamic history quite abit due to this game, like the Abbassids, Umayyads, Seljuks, Fatimids, the Ilkhanate. When and where they came from and when and why they fell..

Also didn't know about the bretons or the Carolingian empire before this game, and my knowledge of the reconqista was miserable (more or less thought is was Rome - Goths - Moors - Spain & Portugal). Hadn't heard about the Almoravids, Navarra, Leon or the crown of Aragon before.

I was a history and map nerd before Paradox got it's claws in me. But yeah this is one of the games I suggest when trying to co vert your nerd friends to being map nerds

Look the game is fun but it's not magic. Learning the names of places doesn't count as being "good at geography" unless you're in primary school. And bragging about how you recognise a name really isn't that impressive, even if you heard of it while playing a computer game. Enjoy playing but stop acting like it makes you some kind of "renaissance man".

I kicked ass on map tests in my history class because of this game lol

Both this, eu4, and HOI.

This but with hearts of iron 4.

Being that I only had a vague idea of European geography before...yes, I can now name where Venice is. (If you pressured me to, I'd probably be able to do some Italian and Spanish counties, though don't expect me to remember the French or German ones any time soon)

A lot of video games have helped with things like that.   Asheron's Call had a magic system that required certain amounts of powdered precious gems for casting spells, everything you could think of, diamonds, gold, amber, silver, emeralds....  I won a trivia game because the precious gemstones category came up and there wasn't one I didn't know.

I'd say eu4 and hoi4 r more helpful in this regard, ck2 borders r a bit too different from out modern ones for it to make sense in a modern concept. I mean b4 eu4, I had no idea that Paris was a city in France or that Austria was anything more than a name that may or may not be related to Australia, or that Prussia was not another name for Russia. 

Maybe because my school used the books with the shittiest maps in the world 🤷‍♂️

I wouldn't say I've become extremely good at history/geography from this game (and eu4), it is a game after all but it's definitely helped improve my knowledge and I've used what i know from studying the game map to help get points in pub quizzes on more than one occasion :D

I always knew a bit of geography from football, a club from X country includes its town's or city's name in its name so I know that X town or city is in that country. But PDX games have taught me more obscure regions, for example I like playing as the Gideon dynasty because of its COA, position and religion, and I've learned Ethiopian geography for sure and some sub-saharan, Egyptian etc. too. When it comes to history you certainly learn historical names and historical significance of regions, like Bohemia being the Czech Republic now, historical significance of the Normans who have given their name to Normandy, where certain cultures stem from and where they settled like many Germanic peoples settling elsewhere, Visigoths in Iberia, Lombards in Italy etc.

This game is the only reason I felt confident enough to take AP European History this year.

I discovered the Byzantine Empire while playing, never heard of it before (public schools ha ha)

Sure, me too, but for the sake of argument, let me quote Korzybski: [The map is not the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation). In every strategy game, the map is the territory, because the map is the only representation the game has of reality. There is no ambiguity, or false knowledge, or alternate interpretations. There is sometimes a fog of war or terra incognita, but things never actually shift behind them. The game avoids lying to the player about itself. In real life, any map is an approximation and every map is wrong to a lesser or greater extent.

Extremely good idk, but probably a bit above average yeah.

>I find it funny how players often have a favored place to start and would have a pretty good knowledge of this place while don't really knowing anything about the rest.

I can feel this so much! Never been to Ireland IRL, but with the time I've spent on this damn island, I almost feel Irish ♥

&#x200B;

One thing to note: there are many mods that can further improve the 'educational value' of the game. An easy start is to search for 'historical' keyword in Steam workshop.

This game has taught me about as much history as Stellaris has taught me interstellar physics. Which is to say, not really any, but it could be considered inspirational

Yeah. Once, I was returning from Jena (former bishopric, now city in the county of Thüringia (I think)), and I was going home with a train. It is about 6 hours of way, since I live in the county of Leitmeritz (or Litoměřice if it ain't owned by a German.). It was my first way, so I had no idea how to determine how far I was or how long it would take. Until we arrived into Plauen, obviously in the county of Plauen. That gave me all the knowledge I needed, and I knew that it would take about 4 hours to get home.

Yep i accidentally went off on people for bad geometry once for school mandated geography test and they were acting like it was the worst thing ever

EU 4 actually, but yeah.

No joke, I think geography and history classes in school should be based entirely on playing CKII games, then researching and doing reports on areas, religions, events, characters, etc from each student's game.

My public education in European geography and history was so trash that it could basically be summed up as, "America came from England. Oh, and Alexander the Great did some stuff." It could have been more complex and actually taught something, but I get the sneaking suspicion that 1) even in the "gifted" class, the kids were little shits and would have refused to learn and 2) some of our teachers probably didn't know shit about Europe either.

Oh, if only I see that Finnish dude's face again though. "You probably don't know anything about Finland though, huh?" "Well, I don't know much about Finland, but I know quite a lot about the Suomenusko faith, like Ukko and Ahti, etc." "What? How do you know about Finland's really old religion??" "I play videogames, brah."

Well, i already it maknly. But regarding politic I BECAME A GOD!!¡!!! LOL jwk
