Annoying looting mechanic

Soo, I remember a time from before Iron Century, when after looting a holding you had an option to  either take the spoils for yourself or let your people have some fun. Something like this anyway.
Since the latest update, after I loot a holding while raiding, I get a message, basically saying: Your men started to rape and pillage. I can either try to stop it (lol), or loose prestige, letting them have some fun. Is this a bug? Isn't this the whole reason for looting countries as tribal pagans?
Is it a bug that needs to be fixed, or did we suddenly became the good kind of pagans, that just take the gold and not rape everything in sight?

I get the idea. It also happens after sieging during war and that makes sense to me. Putting this mechanic into raiding is ridiculous though.

The 1st event you are talking about is either HIP or a warrior lodge event. 

Now the 2nd one is a fucking travesty. Its broken and stupid that Vikings would give a shit.

I still get the first option, but I agree that the second option shouldn't really exist for raiding pagans cause... Doesn't really make any sense.

CK2's quality control has gone to shit since Holy Fury released. Something you've just got to learn to live with at this point.
