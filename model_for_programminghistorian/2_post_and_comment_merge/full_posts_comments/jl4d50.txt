The story of Emperor John "The Avatar of Jesus"/Imparat Ioan "Avatarul lui Iisus"

 

**The years under the Bulgars**

*Independence and growth*

The story of Ioan begins during his times as a vassal to the Tsardom of Bulgaria, having inherited from his father the counties of the duchy of Oltenia, though not the duchy itself, and the county just west of his oltenian stronghold, being a vassal of the duke of Muntenia. Ioan was a fairly complex man, being highly zealous but also a very content man, and this would cause him at first to be a loyal vassal to his muntenian overlord, however over time relations would sour between them due to the decadence of the muntenian duke, resulting in his most important decision when he was 23 years old. He would become free of muntenian yoke and become a direct vassal of the Tsar, to become a bulwark against the north so neither barbarians nor decadence may take over the wallachian holds of the Tsardom.

This would result in his first war of independence shortly after, after all, how could he become the bulwark to protect christendom against heathens, heretics, barbarians and decadence while the vassal of a decadent ruler? The war was won surprisingly easy as although the muntenian duke had more resources in total Ioan was a far greater commander and was able to use his lesser resource much more effectively, winning the war in less than a year and distinguishing himself rapidly as an adept commander. However, shortly after the decadent Tsar Boris would throw him under the vassalage of the duke of Ohrid, who had no right to be his liege and probably only became such due to being related to Tsar Boris and begging him for someone as skilled as Ioan to be his vassal. The second war of independence would be won as well fairly easily due to his military prowess but upon returning home to Severin Ioan would find a message that made him detest the Tsar nearly to the point of rebellion, only Tsar Boris’ power and Ioan’s content nature keeping him from doing such, as he had barely come back from his campaign for independence from the duke of Ohrid that he had once more become a vassal of the very same duke, making his war meaningless.

However, on the 20th of September 887 Boris would die and would be succeeded by Tsar Vladimir “the Evil”, and with this succession the attitude of the Tsardom towards Ioan would also change drastically. On the 15th of October 888, only 11 days after it’s creation, the duchy of Cenad was handed to Ioan by Tsar Vladimir. This would begin a friendship between Tsar Vladimir and Ioan as Ioan would grow to respect the cunning and capable Vladimir even for his borderline barbarophile views and craven nature, while Vladimir would grow to hold Ioan’s military prowess in high regard as Ioan became a renowned commander of the Tsardom winning victory’s consistently for the Tsardom. This is also when Ioan’s ascension would truly begin as he would then use a claim he had fabricated to conquer the duchy of Muntenia so as to increase his military capability to better hold back the barbarian tides of the north, officially becoming duke of Muntenia on the 4th of July 889.

*The Hungarian rivalry*

For a while, his growth as duke of both Cenad and Muntenia would bring great prosperity to the realm as he would transform from a mere count into easily the strongest vassal in the realm, having over 6500 men, nearly as much as the Tsar himself, however due to his content nature and Tsar Vladimir’s kindness towards him he’d grown rather fond of the Tsar’s, finding them useful allies in his position as bulwark of the north for orthodoxy, brother of the anatolian rulers who held a title similar to his but in the east. However, his high of power would soon end as on the 13th of December 897 Arpad would conquer the majority of Pannonia with a horde so great not even the full might of Janos could stop him, especially since he had been severely weakened by another war recently reducing his army to only a 6th of it’s normal size, at 6 thousand men. Over the course of multiple wars Arpad would push further into Bulgaria’s lands within Pannonia, each time making sure to personally siege Severin, capturing the children and even wife at one point of Ioan, turning her into his concubine for the rest of her life as his army remained untouchable even by Ioan, with all of his military expertise, resulting in the deep hatred for all magyars Ioan would display later in life.

**Total defeat at the hands of the mongol hordes**

*The end of the Roman Empire and the Tsardom*

When news first appeared of the mongol horde rapidly moving towards the middle east, Ioan was happy, the muslims would likely be weakened severely whether they’d fend him off or not, and the mongol horde would likely fall upon attempting to enter the fortified themes of Anatolia, and from there the Roman Empire could extend it’s reach back across the levant and the holy land itself, possibly resulting in a full rebirth of Rome, and if that were to be the case he would be it’s most loyal servant when it came back. However, that was not to be as instead of falling at the gates of Constantinople the Mongol horde would push through the Anatolian lands like a knife through butter, punching into Anatolia in 937 and conquering the holiest, most impenetrable of cities, Constantinople, on the 15th of October 941, effectively ending the dream of the Roman Empire resurging and bringing forth the word of christ to all corners of the world as Rome was left as nothing but a rump state in Hellas. It would only be 4 years until on the 21st of September 945 that Tarnovo as well, conquering the two cities Ioan had sworn to himself he would protect with his life in the name of christianity.

*A humiliating vassalage*

Not long after the fall of Tarnovo, seeing that the Tsar can no longer protect himself, so much so his own vassals, Ioan decided to declare independence from the Tsardom as to not be caught in it’s fall as well, however as the mongols eyed him up hungrily he was forced eventually to do something that even to this day he does not wish to speak of, he was forced to become a part of the realm of the Magyars, which by this point had converted to orthodoxy, being ruled by the the Great Grandson of Arpad, Linutika II “the Tormentor”, which was a surprisingly unfit title just as Vladimir “the Evil”’s had been, though due to his direct ancestry from Arpad he was still a monster in the eyes of Ioan, one which he only joined under due to his power as Ioan saw the need to continue his realm’s survival as much as possible, lest orthodoxy die at the hands of the demonic mongols who had taken both Constantinople and Tarnovo like they were nothing.

During his time he would begin growing his power base within the Magyar Kingdom, taking back over the lands of the duchy of Cenad and through military conquest conquering the entirety of Moldavia, which would go on to be a land he would mostly to completely hold as his own to this very day, keeping the prime regions of what we nowadays know as little Romania directly under himself and united at all times.

*The mongols finally do something good*

Although the vast Mongol Empire had split into multiple states on the 1st of January 959, it’s remnants, specifically the Ilkhanate which inherited all of Persia, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Hellas, and the Golden Horde which inherited Scythia and the Kievan Rus’ lands, would remain a threat to Ioan for a long time after the death of their great khan. With that however finally the mongols under Kokochu would do something that Ioan didn’t feel completely enraged from, as on the 16th of January 879 they would conquer the majority of Pannonia, taking Cenad from Ioan again, but leaving the rest of his lands mostly unharmed, and thus he saw it as a win seeing as the magyar barbarians finally got a taste of their own rapey medicine once and for all, and simply declared independence once more, this time from the rump state of Magyaroszag.

**The slow fall of the mongols**

After getting his independence, Ioan was pleasantly surprised to see how for some reason not known even to this day both Ilkhanate and Golden Horde both seemed to have zero interest in his lands, leaving him to simply exist within his seemingly encircled pocket of christendom while they raped and pillaged wherever they could outside.

This would be a time of surprising prosperity for the kingdom of Wallachia as it’s regions would remain unmolested by foreign invaders allowing Ioan to build his strength massively. This prosperity was significantly increased as well when on the 9th of June 996 Ioan would conquer the duchy of Chersonos from Saulvedis “the Conqueror” who had conquered it 21 years earlier while the mongols were still expanding and had miraculously managed to hold onto it during that entire time. After this conquest Ioan would set up the nowadays highly renowned Merchant Republic of Chersonos with his son Valentin “the Unchaste” as first Doge of the republic, which is nowadays famed as one of the greatest merchant republics in all of history, sending merchants from from the black sea across the entire mediteranean and atlantic coast by the 13th century and across most of the world by the 16th century, being on one of the main routes of the silk road having made it titanically rich allowing for these investments across the world.

However, by this point the first of the 5 dreaded plagues would hit the world for the first time, killing thousands across the world including many of Ioan’s own family.

In the meantime, the two nearby successor states of the Mongol Empire would finally begin their slow decline as the Ilkhanate officially became an apostolic empire, laying claim to the ancient empire of Eran, also known as Persia, and viewing himself as an armenian moreso than a mongol, bringing a weird turn to the successor state during his ascension in 990. The Golden Horde on the other hand wasn’t nearly as lucky as they would find themselves rapidly destabilizing from 967 to 1013 as they would go from a Tengri Khan to a Catholic one, back to a tengri one and then finally just before the collapse of the Golden horde a Catholic one in 1013, the very same year the Golden horde ceased to be as it collapsed into many different hordes.

Sadly for Ioan and the world, the second of the five dreaded plagues would appear, this time in Iceland, and begin expanding outwards encompassing the entire world once more in sickness and death, likely adding greatly to the already highly unstable situations across the world

By 1018 things would begin to change meanwhile in the south extremely drastically as Bedugun “the Tormenter” would be installed by faction demand on the throne of Eran, transforming Eran back into a mongol Empire, but transforming it from an apostolic one into a Budhist one as Bedugun seemed to have grown inspired by the eastern peoples and adopted a militaristic version of one of their faiths and, extremely surprisingly, finally stabilizing the Empire of Eran under buddhism for the next century.

Over the next century Ioan would begin a series of wars known as the “Recuceririle” or “Reconquests”, in which he would, as the name implies, reconquer much of the land lost to the mongol horde, reconquering Constantinople by 1052 and declaring officially the Empire of Wallachia on the 1st of September 1055, with this date later being declared a national holiday known as “Ziua Renașterii Ortodoxe” or the “Day of the Rebirth of Orthodoxy”, being seen officially as the day Orthodoxy began it’s steep climb back from near death.

By the13th of August 1128, the date Eran was officially gone as a state, Ioan had conquered in the name of Christianity the entirety of Bulgaria, Georgia, Alania, Qazarstan, Scythia and most of Trebizond and the helespont itself, although by this point would would be known as the Dacispont as the entire region had officially became of romanian culture due to the kind hand of Ioan slowly converting them into romanians as the time passed, though the fact that by this point the third of the dreaded plagues had appeared in Constanta no less had likely helped to heavily depopulate the region beforehand anyways so the bringing of romanian settlers was rather helpful to it’s conversion to romanian culture. This was also around the time Konstantinoupolis was renamed to Ioanisdava after petitions from the region which declared it was time for the third chapter of the region, ending the roman chapter of Konstantinoupolis just as it had ended the hellenic chapter of Byzantion.

**Sainthood and the Eternal Empire**

By this point in time people had begun realizing that Imparat Ioan was in fact nearly 300 years old, which was rather obviously extremely above the normal age of man, however while some claimed him to be demonic in nature, others say how extremely pious he was and how he had not only set up a new Kievan Rus under the mongol Bolkhadar who he had personally converted to orthodoxy, not to mention his zealousness, virtue, and not only reconquest but personal reconversion of all of Anatolia and Pannonia and personal conversion of Scythia and the Caucasus region, easily putting him on the same level if not even high above that of a apostle, as such after much consideration Ioan was declared a living saint for his extreme virtue, zealotry and contributions to the church and orthodox people.

*The Brothers war*

Around this time on the 28th of January 1105 all the way to the 6th of July 1106 there would also be the highly renowned “Brothers War” as it was called, being a war between the brother churches of orthodoxy and catholicism over the county of Traianoupolis which a noble within the Thema of Bulgaria had used a favor on Ioan to get him to declare war over. The reason this war was such a great one was because it was against the pope who had taken Hellas for himself in a show of greed in the middle of a crusade, and at who’s defence came the entirety of Germania, Italia and Lotharingia to defend the papal holds within Traianoupolis, and many at the time had believed Ioan would finally fall to his own arrogance of believing he could defeat the catholic world. What the world did not know however was that for the last 100 years Ioan hadd only been using a mere fraction of his empire’s strength, using a combination of mercenaries, retinues and personal levies to raise an entire 21 thousand men single handedly without the sight of even a single vassal troop. Sadly for the papal forces, this 100 year period of total peace for the armies of the many themes of Wallachia would be ended that year as the full might of the Wallachia Empire was brought forth, resulting in Wallachia fighting the papal coalition with it’s full 50k strong might and winning what should’ve been a long and protracted war at best and total humiliation at worst in a single year proving the undefeatability of the Wallachian Empire under Ioan “the Living saint”.

*The wise man who was believed insane*

The next 100 years would be fairly interesting for all of Wallachia as the entirety of Anatolia would be incorporated into the Wallachian Empire with the empire now being seen as a truly legitimate one with the entire black sea as it’s De Jure lands, however surprisingly after this Ioan would bring forth an unprecedented era of peace for the next 100 years as many started believing his advanced age may have finally started catching up to him and believing him insane after he began a series of reforms that among other things reformed the entire prison system of the empire into one of reform instead of punishment and slowly but surely made women completely equal to men legally and culturally, which we now know to have been not madness, but instead merely Ioan realizing how flawed the world was and deciding to try to make the world as virtuous as he could and as much so as possible as Jesus would’ve wanted, removing violence and war and allowing his people to finally take a breath of fresh air from the constant war to prosper and live their lives. When looking back onto this period although this hasn’t been confirmed by him many believe the reason for his decision to suddenly change everything may have also been heavily influenced by the death of his great great great great granddaughter Petra and her daughter Stana to the third wave of the dreaded plague. 

It is believed these along with many other deaths to the dreaded plagues were the reason he began what is nowadays known as “The Medical Revolution”, investing in a genuine wall of hospitals around the entirety of little Romania  and hospitals all across it as well, though the project would be too early to stop the 4th of the dreaded plagues from penetrating little Romania for the first time in history during the 5th dreaded plague a region of the world was finally completely free of plague for the entire duration of the plague, that region having been Oltenia, the deepest imperial heartland of the Wallachian Empire which was second only to Ioanisdava in how wealthy it was at the time, though with time would grow to outshine even the eternal city of Ioanisdava as Severin would become the new eternal city of the world.

Here are for anyone wondering images of the empire, religions inside it, cultures inside it, and the world at large.
