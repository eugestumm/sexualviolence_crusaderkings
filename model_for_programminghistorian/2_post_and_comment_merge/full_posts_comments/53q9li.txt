Is it possible that someone raped your wife?

Playing as a strong, handsome, genius duke of saxony yet I get the event where my wife get pregnant under suspicious circumstances, so I charinfoed it and she is pregnant with the bastard child of a local bishop (is killing a bishop considered an unforgiveable sin? My character is a devout Catholic) she straight up lies to me about the kid so did she get raped or I am going to choke that ho?

In the words of you;

>choke that ho

Rape isn't in the game, but seduction is. 

Yes killing a priest is sin, but so is adultery. That man is not of the cloth!
