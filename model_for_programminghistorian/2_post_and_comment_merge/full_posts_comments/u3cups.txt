The rebirth of Egypt

This campaign took quite some time but it was fun through and through…all the way up until I had to conquer South West Africa, that was a major pain.

\*\*some pictures in the bottom of this massive wall of text\*\*

We start in 867 as the count of Sout Kordofan, a Kushite ruler in the fractured land of Darfur (Technically if you want to make it even more “historical” you can go with a Nubian Kushite start but I somehow ended up in Darfur).

I hope you enjoy reading about the rebirth of Egypt:

“Drumroll, curtains unfurling, grand fanfare…”

The early days were hard for the isolated practitioners of the old Gods of the Nile, surrounded by hostile faiths and harsh lands, each day was a fight for survival.

But the count was no fool, in fact, his lifestyle dictated by his belief in Wepwawet and his extensive knowledge of the art of medicine helped him and his people greatly. People from far and wide flocked to this man of wisdom, seeking reprieve from ailments and guidance during times of strife. The count was content with his lot in life, but destiny, destiny had other plans.

Starting sometime in 868 the tribes from West Kordofan raided his village, killed many and burned their crops in a night of violence and tragedy. In the aftermath, the count wept, for the sacred shrines of the Gods were defiled. Amidst the blaze of the shrine a figure appeared:

“Thou shall go forth and bring justice to the perpetrators,” the voice boomed towards the shocked man: “Thou shall go forth, under the guidance of the almighty Sun and with swift vengeance of the Jackal!”

The count, shocked and in awe spoke no words. He knew what he had to do; his goal was clear. West Kordofan will fall.

The next day all those faithful to the old Gods marched out through the heat of the day and brought terror to the perpetrators of the raids. The west could not hold and soon, with their leaders killed the tribes joined with the south underneath the now newly proclaimed Duke of Kordofan.

But as blood was now tasted the Duke did not stop, he expanded, further and further he drove his army of believers, spreading the true word of the Jackal and the grace of the Sun across the plain of Africa.

But alas, at the old age of 80, the wise man was finally called into the Jackal's embrace, starting but never finishing his task. However, the foundations were set, their faith stronger than ever and his line secure in a wise and just son.

The son continued with the task of his great father and soon all in the land bowed to him as the one true King as anointed by the Jackal and graced by the great everlasting Sun. The king in Darfur reigned supreme, none able to challenge his claim or check his might.

Years passed with constant war, the loot and slaves fuelling a booming economy in the lands of the King. Hise wise and enlightened rule permeated every facet of society. New farming techniques were discovered, ideas from conquered lands were absorbed and the Kushite faith was reformed in light of the changes in society and the social order. Soon the King saw the transformation of his tribal subjects into feudal serfs, yet the Daju people never had time to dwell on their lot in life, as the glorious age of expansion fed all no matter their station or their gender into the massive war machine that was the Jackal’s horde of the African plains.

Further and further the lands of the King were extended, there was no one that could face him and live. In the West Kanem bent the knee to the King of Darfur and in the East Ajuraan, Hiraab and Hafun submitted without a fight. Seeing these great tribes bow most of the horn of Africa submitted to the great Jackal, as he was now known, for only a God or the son of a God could achieve such great deeds in his life.

However, there were some who dared to resist and who had a chance of withstanding the great African tide. The great Jackal King looked to the North, where the bountiful lands of the mother Nile, the ancestor home of the old Gods withered under the Crescent moon and the midnight star.

The old Abbasid Caliphate was long gone, yet the house of Muhammadid held supreme power, unchallenged and resolute all from the sands of old Egypt, through the shores of the Levant and into the ancestral lands of the Arabian desert. The Prophet’s peoples enjoyed a golden age, their culture unmatched by any other and in awe of the barbarous Latins that inhabited the burning wreckage of the once-mighty Roman Eagle. Yet darkness loomed on the horizon for the faithful of the Prophet as preachers of the Cross chanted: “Death to the heathens!” and its warriors replied: “Deus vult!”

Legions of Latins crossed the sea, descending in an orgy of violence across the Levant, burning, raping, pillaging in the name of the Cross. The knights of the cold North crossed blades with the scimitars of the desert in countless battles, with the dead numbered by the thousands feeding carrion birds and colouring the sands red with the blood of the faithful.

As the two behemoths of their respective faiths clashed the now elderly Jackal King watched with glee, his army swelling with new followers by the day. He amassed his forces in the Nubian lands just south of the birth of the great Nile, he watched, he waited. For once the Cross had sufficiently blunted the scimitar of the Crescent moon the Jackal King would strike, tearing into the side of the exhausted foe, devouring him like a pack of rabid animals.

In 1065 the Latins were defeated, the Prophet’s peoples stood firm, yet they were exhausted, their lands were burned, their cities in ruins, it was time for the Jackal to strike.

Swift was the Jackal’s strike, his army swept through the Nile’s fertile lands, its peoples left defenceless and weak in the aftermath of the great holy war. The caliph was taken by surprise, he hastily mustered his armies and met the great Jackal King at the walls of Cairo, his rule of these lands challenged once again.

The two armies met in such a force that the Nile ran red as never before, the dead carried into the sea by the great nourishing waters that once filled these lands with an abundance of life. Both sides fought with a murderous zeal, each warrior calling forth the strength of his God to smite down the unbeliever that dared challenge him. Time and time again the name of the Great Jackal was invoked to meet the scimitars of the one God, ending with the death of the faithful on both sides.

It felt as if the world itself is ending in those days, that humanity will feed a never-ending stream of men into the grinder at the banks of the Nile, yet the fighting did not stop. In the end, the Empire of the Arabian desert, too exhausted from its fight with the Latins to withstand this second tide emanating from the south of the continent, slowly lost ground, yet they made the invader pay dearly for each foot of land taken. Cairo fell in the second year of this war and the Caliph was forced to withdraw his troops from the plains of Egypt all the way across the Sinai.

It pained the Caliph dearly but there was no point in continuing the fight. Divisions and unrest within his lands forced him to make peace with the Great Jackal, the price of peace, the bountiful lands of Egypt, the breadbasket of empires both ancient and new.

And so it was that in 1072 the Kingdom of Egypt was wrestled from the hands of the Prophet’s faithful and embraced by the newly established and rejuvenated Empire of Egypt, under the Great Jackal, the sword of Wepwawet, the descendent of the Sun and the conqueror of Africa.

Yet just as with his great father the new Emperor did not enjoy his accolades for long. For after a lifetime of warfare and service to the old Gods, the Great Jackal was called into the embrace of his godly ancestors and his great spirit shed his mortal coils, living behind a legend that will permeate all of human history henceforth.

His descendants were many and the Great Jackal’s line was solid. Both men and women sat on the Nile’s throne in Cairo, each adding their own accomplishment to the great mosaic that was the Empire of Egypt. Soon the peoples of Egypt and the peoples of Africa were joined in a union as a new culture developed in the melting pot that was the land of the Nile. The Nile fed them and the people expanded, sheltered under the glory of their Jackal emperors and united in faith to Wepwawet the great and all-conquering.

Decades passed, wars were waged and lands were gained. Then in 1245, after centuries of near-constant expansion, the great Ankhesenamun, High Priestess of the Kushites, daughter of the most illustrious line blessed by the Jackal God felled her last enemy in Africa and declared that Africa was henceforth united under the glory of the Great Jackal and the Everlasting Sun, never to be torn asunder.

And so continued the Golden age of Egypt, reborn Empire of the Nile, never faltering in its faith to the Gods in the face of any opponent.

Yet, as history teaches us, Empires rise and fall, and far to the East, the hooves of the horse lords can be heard thundering through the Asian steps, eager to unite the world under the banner of the Eternal Blue Heaven.

You made my day OP, aspiring to write such a piece one day

lol, my favourite parts were seeing the evolution of the Muslim world with the rise of Persia and the majid assuming power.
