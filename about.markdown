Hi there! My name is [Euge Stumm](eugestumm.github.io) (they/them), I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Literary, Cultural and Linguistic Studies at the University of Miami. 

This is my project on Crusader Kings and sexual violence. My goal is to analyze how the community of players of the video game series Crusader Kings dealed with rape speech in their biggest Reddit community. I used the data collected from PRAW Reddit API with sentiment analysis using VADER sentiment analysis tool and descriptive and exploratory statistics to visualize and interpret the data. 

It is my final project for the Digital Humanities Practicum course, which I worked under the guidance of Professor Susanna All√©s-Torrent at the University of Miami. The original source code of this project is in a private repository containing all the data and code used to scrap data. Since it contains my private API keys for Reddit, I cannot make it public. Here you can see a version without my Reddit API keys. 

Here is my contact [ehs89@miami.edu](ehs89@miami.edu)
